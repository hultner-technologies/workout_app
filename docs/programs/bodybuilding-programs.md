## 1. Reddit PPL (Metallicadpa)

### Name
**Reddit PPL** (Push/Pull/Legs - Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners)

### Author/Source
- **Creator**: u/Metallicadpa (Reddit user)
- **Original Post**: [r/Fitness Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/)
- **Archived Version**: [The Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/reddit-archive/a-linear-progression-based-ppl-program-for-beginners/)

### Description

The Reddit PPL is a high-frequency, high-volume, linear progression program designed specifically for beginners who want to train more frequently while still progressing appropriately. Created by Metallicadpa, this program became one of the most popular beginner routines on r/Fitness.

The program reconciles conventional training wisdom for beginners with what beginners actually want to do - train more frequently. Unlike traditional 3-day full-body routines, this allows beginners to be in the gym 6 days per week while still making linear progress on compound lifts.

The philosophy centers around hitting each muscle group twice per week with a mix of heavy compound movements and higher-rep accessory work. The program balances strength development through progressive overload on main lifts with hypertrophy work on isolation exercises.

This program is ideal for beginners who have mastered basic form on compound lifts and are ready to commit to a higher training frequency. It's particularly suited for those who enjoy frequent gym sessions and want to maximize muscle growth while building a strength foundation.

### Structure
- **Frequency**: 6 days per week
- **Split**: Push / Pull / Legs repeated twice
- **Schedule Options**:
  - PPLRPPL (rest day after first cycle)
  - PPLPPLR (rest day at end of week)
- **Session Duration**: 60-90 minutes per session

### Session Breakdown

#### **Pull Day**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Deadlifts (alternating) | 1×5+ | Heavy, AMRAP on final set |
| Barbell Rows (alternating) | 4×5, 1×5+ | Alternative to deadlifts |
| Pulldowns/Pullups/Chinups | 3×8-12 | Any grip variation |
| Seated Cable Rows | 3×8-12 | Or chest-supported rows |
| Face Pulls | 5×15-20 | Rear delt focus |
| Hammer Curls | 4×8-12 | Brachialis focus |
| Dumbbell Curls | 4×8-12 | Bicep isolation |

**Notes**:
- Alternate between deadlifts and barbell rows each Pull day
- When doing deadlifts: 1×5+ (single heavy set)
- When doing rows: 4×5, 1×5+ (standard progression)

#### **Push Day**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Bench Press (alternating) | 4×5, 1×5+ | Heavy compound |
| Overhead Press (alternating) | 4×5, 1×5+ | Alternative to bench |
| Opposite Press | 3×8-12 | Whichever wasn't done first |
| Incline Dumbbell Press | 3×8-12 | Upper chest focus |
| Tricep Pushdowns SS Lateral Raises | 3×8-12 SS 3×15-20 | Superset |
| Overhead Tricep Extension SS Lateral Raises | 3×8-12 SS 3×15-20 | Superset |

**Notes**:
- Alternate main movement each Push day (Bench/OHP)
- The movement not done as main lift is done for 3×8-12
- SS = Superset (perform exercises back-to-back)

#### **Leg Day**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Squats | 2×5, 1×5+ | Heavy, AMRAP final set |
| Romanian Deadlifts | 3×8-12 | Hamstring/glute focus |
| Leg Press | 3×8-12 | Quad volume |
| Leg Curls | 3×8-12 | Hamstring isolation |
| Calf Raises | 5×8-12 | High volume calves |

### Rest Periods
- **Main compound lifts** (5+ sets): 3-5 minutes
- **Accessory exercises** (8-12 rep range): 1-3 minutes
- **Isolation work**: 1-2 minutes

### Progression Scheme

**Linear Progression**:
- **Upper body lifts** (bench, OHP, rows): Add 2.5kg/5lbs per session when hitting target
- **Squats**: Add 2.5kg/5lbs per session when hitting target
- **Deadlifts**: Add 5kg/10lbs per session when hitting target

**AMRAP Sets**: The final set of main lifts is performed AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) while maintaining good form. This allows for autoregulation and ensures progressive overload.

**Accessory Progression**:
- When you can complete 3 sets of 12 reps with good form, increase weight
- Stay within 8-12 rep range (double progression method)
- If you drop below 8 reps on any set, weight is too heavy

### Program Duration
**Indefinite / Ongoing** - Run until linear progression stalls (typically 3-6 months for beginners), then transition to intermediate program.

## 2. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Golden Six

### Name
**Arnold's Golden Six**

### Author/Source
- **Creator**: Arnold Schwarzenegger
- **Era**: 1966 (Munich training period)
- **Source**: Arnold's personal training history, documented in various bodybuilding publications

### Description

The Golden Six is Arnold Schwarzenegger's foundational program that he credits with building his initial muscle mass after moving to Munich in 1966. In Arnold's own words: "When I was trying to get bigger in my early days of training, I followed a routine called the Golden Six. I made tremendous gains on this program and so did many others who trained at my gym in Munich."

This old-school bodybuilding routine centers around six fundamental compound exercises performed three times per week. The philosophy is simple: master the basic movements with progressive overload and high volume to build a solid foundation of muscle mass.

The program represents Arnold's training before he transitioned to the high-volume split training he became famous for during his competitive years. It emphasizes basic barbell movements and pullups, focusing on pure strength and size gains without the complexity of advanced training techniques.

The Golden Six is ideal for beginners and early intermediates who want a proven, straightforward program. It requires only basic gym equipment (barbell, weights, pullup bar) and can be completed in 60-90 minutes per session. The simplicity makes it easy to follow and track progress.

### Structure
- **Frequency**: 3 days per week (full body)
- **Schedule**: Non-consecutive days (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday)
- **Session Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Split**: Full body every session

### Session Breakdown

#### **Full Body Session** (performed 3x per week)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Rest |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Barbell Squat | 4 | 10 | Up to 2 minutes |
| Wide-Grip Bench Press | 3 | 10 | 60-90 seconds |
| Chin-Ups | 3 | AMRAP | 60-90 seconds |
| Behind-the-Neck Overhead Press | 4 | 10 | 60-90 seconds |
| Barbell Curl | 3 | 10 | 60-90 seconds |
| Bent-Knee Sit-Ups | 3-4 | AMRAP | 60 seconds |

**Exercise Notes**:
- **Squat**: Full depth, focus on proper form
- **Bench Press**: Wide grip to emphasize chest
- **Chin-Ups**: Can substitute with pulldowns if needed, work toward bodyweight pullups
- **Behind-the-Neck Press**: Can substitute with standard overhead press if shoulder mobility is limited
- **Barbell Curl**: Strict form, no momentum
- **Sit-Ups**: Bent knees to reduce hip flexor involvement

### Rest Periods
- **Squats**: Up to 2 minutes
- **All other exercises**: 60-90 seconds

### Progression Scheme

**Linear Progression with AMRAP Testing**:

1. Perform prescribed sets and reps (e.g., 3 sets of 10)
2. On final set of each exercise, perform AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible)
3. If you achieve 13+ reps on the AMRAP set, increase weight next session
4. Add 5 lbs (2.5 kg) per session when hitting progression target

**Weekly Potential**: Up to 15 lbs / 7.5 kg added to lifts per week if progressing on all three sessions

**Volume Progression**: Once linear progression stalls, can add sets (e.g., 4 sets instead of 3) before transitioning to intermediate program

### Program Duration

**Indefinite** - Designed to be run continuously until linear progression stalls. Arnold recommends resetting every 12 weeks to prevent plateaus (deload and rebuild).

Typical run time for beginners: 3-6 months before transitioning to higher-frequency split training.

1. **Arnold's Testimony**: Directly credited by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself as the program that built his initial muscle mass
2. **Simplicity**: Easy to follow, hard to mess up - focuses on fundamental movements
3. **Full Body Frequency**: Trains each muscle group 3x per week, ideal for beginners' recovery capacity
4. **Time-Tested**: Used successfully by countless lifters since the 1960s
5. **Minimal Equipment**: Requires only barbell, plates, and pullup bar
6. **Foundation Building**: Develops strength base and neural adaptations for advanced training

The program represents a period when bodybuilding training was simpler but highly effective. It's frequently recommended for beginners who want a proven, no-nonsense approach to building muscle.

**Historical Context**: This program predates modern exercise science but aligns well with current understanding of beginner training - high frequency, compound movements, progressive overload, and adequate volume.

### Exercise Library Compatibility

**Exercises already in database**:

## 3. Arnold Split (Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding)

### Name
**The Arnold Split** (also known as Arnold's Level 1 Program or Arnold's 6-Day Split)

### Author/Source
- **Creator**: Arnold Schwarzenegger
- **Source**: "The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding" (1985) by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bill Dobbins
- **Level**: Advanced beginner to intermediate (despite being called "Level 1")

### Description

The Arnold Split is the high-volume, high-frequency training program Arnold Schwarzenegger used during his competitive bodybuilding career. Outlined in his 1985 book "The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding," this is the "Level 1" routine, which, despite the name, is not truly for beginners - it represents an advanced training approach.

The philosophy behind the Arnold Split is brutally simple: maximum volume, maximum frequency, and relentless intensity. Arnold often trained twice per day, six days per week, using a body part split where each muscle group was hit with extremely high volume using both compound and isolation movements. The program emphasizes training opposing muscle groups together (chest/back, biceps/triceps) to create powerful muscle pumps and maximize training density.

Arnold's approach included extensive use of supersets, particularly pairing chest and back exercises. He believed this antagonistic pairing created superior muscle density and allowed him to accomplish massive training volume in relatively short timeframes. Each workout could include 20-30+ total sets for the muscle groups trained, with minimal rest between exercises.

This program is for experienced intermediate and advanced lifters who have built a solid foundation of strength, mastered exercise form, and developed the work capacity to handle very high training volumes. It requires exceptional recovery ability, proper nutrition, and often 2+ hours in the gym per session. Arnold himself acknowledged that most people would need to work up to this level of volume.

### Structure
- **Frequency**: 6 days per week
- **Split Type**: Body part split (Chest/Back, Shoulders/Arms, Legs)
- **Schedule**: Each workout performed twice weekly
- **Session Duration**: 90-150 minutes per session (often split into 2 daily sessions)
- **Training Days**:
  - Day 1: Chest & Back
  - Day 2: Shoulders & Arms
  - Day 3: Legs & Lower Back
  - Day 4-6: Repeat

### Rest Periods
- **60 seconds or less** between most sets
- **30-45 seconds** during supersets
- **No more than 90 seconds** even on heavy compounds

Arnold emphasized keeping rest periods short to maintain muscle pump and training intensity.

### Progression Scheme

**Pyramid Training**:
- Start lighter with higher reps (12-15)
- Increase weight each set while decreasing reps
- Final sets are heaviest with lowest reps (6-8)

**Progressive Overload**:
- When able to complete all sets in the top rep range, add weight
- Focus on increasing strength on compound movements
- Maintain strict form - no ego lifting

**Volume Progression**:
- Advanced trainees can add sets over time
- Arnold's "Level 2" and "Advanced" programs include even more volume

**Instinctive Training**:
- Arnold advocated listening to your body
- Add sets if muscle isn't fully pumped
- Use techniques like forced reps, drop sets, and supersets when appropriate

### Program Duration

**8-12 week cycles** with deload weeks recommended.

This program should be run for several months, with periodic deloads (reduce volume by 40-50% for one week every 6-8 weeks). Many bodybuilders run variations of this split for years, adjusting exercises and techniques.

**Prerequisites**:
- At least 1-2 years of consistent training
- Mastery of compound movements
- Ability to train 6 days per week
- Excellent nutrition and sleep for recovery

### Evidence Base

The Arnold Split is legendary in bodybuilding for these reasons:

1. **Arnold's Results**: Produced arguably the greatest physique in bodybuilding history (7x Mr. Olympia)
2. **Golden Era Proven**: Used by numerous champion bodybuilders of the 1960s-70s
3. **High Frequency**: Trains each muscle 2x per week with extremely high volume
4. **Muscle Confusion**: Varied rep ranges and techniques prevent adaptation
5. **Pump Training**: Antagonistic supersets create superior muscle pumps
6. **Time-Tested**: Variations still used by competitive bodybuilders today

**Important Caveats**:
- Arnold's genetics, dedication, and recovery capacity were exceptional
- The program requires significant time commitment (2+ hours/day)
- Not suitable for natural beginners - requires built-up work capacity
- Many modern coaches recommend lower volumes for natural lifters
- Arnold's era of bodybuilding likely included performance-enhancing substances that aided recovery

Despite these caveats, the program demonstrates principles that work: high frequency, high volume, progressive overload, and diverse exercise selection. Modified versions with reduced volume are popular among natural bodybuilders.

## 4. Upper/Lower 4-Day Split (PHUL)

### Name
**PHUL** (Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower)

### Author/Source
- **Creator**: Brandon Campbell (fitness YouTuber and coach)
- **Platform**: Originally shared on bodybuilding forums and YouTube
- **Level**: Intermediate (1+ years of consistent training)

### Description

PHUL stands for Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower and represents a sophisticated approach to training that balances strength development with muscle growth. The program splits training into four days: two power (strength) days and two hypertrophy (muscle growth) days, alternating between upper and lower body.

The philosophy behind PHUL is that strength and size are complementary goals that should both be trained within the same program. Power days focus on heavy compound movements in the 3-5 rep range to build maximum strength and neuromuscular efficiency. Hypertrophy days use moderate weights in the 8-12 rep range to accumulate volume and create metabolic stress - both key drivers of muscle growth.

This dual approach allows lifters to get stronger on the main lifts (bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press) while also performing enough volume work to maximize muscle growth. The program emphasizes progressive overload on compound movements while including targeted isolation work for weak points and muscle balance.

PHUL is ideal for intermediate lifters who have mastered the basic movement patterns and are ready for a more sophisticated training approach. It requires 4 days per week in the gym, making it more sustainable than 6-day programs while still providing optimal training frequency (hitting each muscle group twice weekly).

### Structure
- **Frequency**: 4 days per week
- **Split**: Upper/Lower with Power and Hypertrophy emphasis
- **Schedule**:
  - Day 1: Upper Power
  - Day 2: Lower Power
  - Day 3: Rest

- **Hypertrophy days (8-12 reps)**: 60-120 seconds
- **Isolation exercises**: 60-90 seconds

### Progression Scheme

**Power Days (Linear Progression)**:
- When you hit the top of the rep range (5 reps) for all sets, add weight
- Add 2.5kg/5lbs to upper body lifts
- Add 5kg/10lbs to lower body lifts
- Focus on strength progression on compounds

**Hypertrophy Days (Double Progression)**:
- First progress reps within the range (8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12)
- When hitting 12 reps for all sets, increase weight and drop back to 8 reps
- Smaller jumps: 1.25-2.5kg (2.5-5lbs) increments

**Periodization Option**:
- Run 4-6 week blocks
- Deload on week 5 or 7 (reduce weight by 40%, maintain reps)
- Can adjust rep ranges slightly every 4-6 weeks

**Customization**:
- Exercise selection can be modified based on individual needs
- Weak points can be prioritized with additional sets
- Can adjust volume (sets) based on recovery ability

### Program Duration

**8-12 week cycles** with deload weeks.

Run for 4-6 weeks, take a deload week (reduce volume/intensity by 40-50%), then continue for another 4-6 weeks. Program can be run indefinitely with periodic deloads and exercise variations.

Ideal for: Intermediate lifters for 6-12 months before potentially moving to more specialized programming.

1. **Dual Emphasis**: Combines strength and hypertrophy training, addressing both neural and metabolic adaptations
2. **Training Frequency**: Hits each muscle group 2x per week, optimal for intermediates
3. **Scientific Backing**: Rep ranges align with research on strength (3-5 reps) vs. hypertrophy (8-12 reps)
4. **Sustainable Frequency**: 4 days/week is manageable for most lifters with work/life balance
5. **Proven Results**: Thousands of documented transformations across forums and social media
6. **Flexibility**: Allows exercise substitutions while maintaining program structure
7. **Progressive Overload**: Clear progression schemes for both power and hypertrophy phases

**Research Support**:
- Training muscle groups 2x/week superior to 1x/week for hypertrophy (Schoenfeld et al., 2016)
- Heavy loads (3-5 reps) build maximal strength through neural adaptations
- Moderate loads (8-12 reps) with higher volume optimize muscle growth
- Variety in rep ranges may be superior to single rep range (Fonseca et al., 2014)

The program is frequently recommended by evidence-based coaches like Mike Israetel, Eric Helms, and Greg Nuckols as a solid intermediate template.

## 5. Lyle McDonald's Generic Bulking Routine

### Name
**Lyle McDonald's Generic Bulking Routine (GBR)**

### Author/Source
- **Creator**: Lyle McDonald (nutrition and training expert)
- **Platform**: Originally posted on Lyle McDonald's forum (bodyrecomposition.com)
- **Preserved Source**: [JCD Fitness - Lyle's Bulking Routine](https://jcdfitness.com/2009/01/lyle-mcdonalds-bulking-routine/)
- **FAQ**: [Lyle McDonald GBR FAQ](https://jcdfitness.com/wp-content/download/Lyle_McDonald_Generic_Bulking_Routine_FAQ.pdf)
- **Level**: Intermediate (1-3 years of training experience)

### Description

Lyle McDonald's Generic Bulking Routine is a 4-day upper/lower split specifically designed for intermediate lifters during a caloric surplus with the goal of gaining 0.5-1 pound per week. Created by Lyle McDonald, one of the most respected figures in evidence-based fitness, this program focuses on building maximum muscle mass while minimizing fat gain.

The philosophy centers on flexible programming with varied set and rep ranges based on exercise type and position in the workout. The program uses a tiered approach: heavy compounds for 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps, secondary movements for 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps, and isolation work for 1-2 sets of 12-15 reps. This structure allows for strength gains on main lifts while accumulating sufficient volume for hypertrophy.

What makes this program "generic" is its flexibility - Lyle provides exercise categories and set/rep guidelines rather than prescribing every specific exercise. This allows lifters to choose exercises based on individual biomechanics, equipment availability, and preferences while maintaining the program's core structure.

The program emphasizes autoregulation: lifters make judgment calls about whether to perform a 3rd or 4th set based on performance and fatigue levels. This intelligent approach to volume management helps prevent overtraining while maximizing muscle growth. The routine should be paired with a structured nutritional surplus for optimal results.

GBR is ideal for intermediate lifters (1-3 years of consistent training) who have exhausted beginner linear progression and are ready for a more nuanced approach to programming. It requires understanding of exercise selection, intensity management, and nutritional planning.

### Structure
- **Frequency**: 4 days per week
- **Split**: Upper/Lower
- **Schedule**:
  - Monday: Lower Body
  - Tuesday: Upper Body
  - Wednesday: Rest
  - Thursday: Lower Body
  - Friday: Upper Body
  - Weekend: Rest
- **Session Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Program Length**: 6-8 weeks before mandatory deload

### Session Breakdown

#### **Monday & Thursday: Lower Body**

| Exercise Category | Sets | Reps | Rest | Example Exercises |
|------------------|------|------|------|-------------------|
| Squat | 3-4 | 6-8 | 3 min | Back squat, front squat |
| SLDL or Leg Curl | 3-4 | 6-8 | 3 min | Stiff-leg deadlift, Romanian deadlift, lying leg curl |
| Leg Press | 2-3 | 10-12 | 2 min | 45-degree leg press, hack squat |
| Leg Curl | 2-3 | 10-12 | 2 min | Lying, seated, or standing leg curl |
| Calf Raise | 3-4 | 6-8 | 3 min | Standing calf raise (heavy) |
| Seated Calf | 2-3 | 10-12 | 2 min | Seated calf raise |

**Notes**:
- Can substitute deadlifts for squats on Thursday
- SLDL = Stiff-Leg Deadlift (can use Romanian Deadlift)
- Choose one option from each category based on preference/equipment

#### **Tuesday & Friday: Upper Body**

| Exercise Category | Sets | Reps | Rest | Example Exercises |
|------------------|------|------|------|-------------------|
| Flat Bench Press | 3-4 | 6-8 | 3 min | Barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press |
| Row | 3-4 | 6-8 | 3 min | Barbell row, dumbbell row, T-bar row |
| Incline Press or Shoulder Press | 2-3 | 10-12 | 2 min | Incline barbell/dumbbell press, overhead press |
| Pulldown or Chin-up | 2-3 | 10-12 | 2 min | Lat pulldown, weighted chin-ups |
| Triceps | 1-2 | 12-15 | 90 sec | Pushdowns, overhead extensions, dips |
| Biceps | 1-2 | 12-15 | 90 sec | Barbell curls, dumbbell curls, cable curls |

**Optional Additions**:
- Rear delt work: 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps (face pulls, reverse flyes)
- Rotator cuff work: 1-2 sets of 15-20 reps
- Abs: 2-3 sets as needed

**Notes**:
- Exercise selection is flexible within categories
- Can alternate exercises between Tuesday and Friday
- Some lifters prefer deadlifts on Thursday instead of squatting twice weekly

### Rest Periods
- **6-8 rep range** (main compounds): 3 minutes
- **10-12 rep range** (secondary movements): 2 minutes
- **12-15 rep range** (isolation work): 90 seconds

### Progression Scheme

The GBR uses a sophisticated 3-phase progression model:

#### **Phase 1: Week 1 (Baseline Establishment)**
- Start at 80-85% of your estimated rep max
- Complete prescribed sets and reps
- Focus on perfect form and establishing baseline weights

#### **Phase 2: Weeks 2-4 (Weekly Progression)**
- Add 5% to all lifts each week
- Example: If you squatted 225 lbs in Week 1, use 236 lbs in Week 2
- This aggressive progression works early in the cycle

#### **Phase 3: Weeks 5-8 (Per-Session Progression)**
- When weekly jumps become difficult, switch to per-session progression
- Add weight only when completing all sets with 1-2 reps in reserve (RIR)
- **Lower body compounds**: Add 5-10 lbs when hitting target reps
- **Upper body compounds**: Add 2.5-5 lbs when hitting target reps
- **Accessories**: Add 1-2.5 lbs or increase reps

#### **Autoregulation: The 3rd vs 4th Set Decision**
After completing 3 sets, assess:
- **Do 4th set if**: Form was solid, bar speed good, didn't grind reps
- **Skip 4th set if**: Form degraded, bar speed slowed significantly, or RPE was 9-10

This judgment call is crucial to GBR's effectiveness - it prevents junk volume while allowing high-responders to accumulate more work.

#### **Deload: Weeks 9 or Every 6-8 Weeks**
- Reduce weights by 40-50%
- Maintain reps and sets
- One week of easy training
- Return to normal weights and begin new cycle

### Program Duration

**6-8 week cycles** with mandatory deload week.

Run the program for 6-8 weeks, deload for one week, then begin a new cycle. Can be run for multiple cycles (6-12 months) as long as you're in a caloric surplus and making progress.

**When to stop**:
- Transition to maintenance/cutting phase
- Progress stalls despite deloads
- Ready for more specialized programming (e.g., block periodization)

## 6. Fierce 5 Program

### Name
**Fierce 5 Novice Routine**

### Author/Source
- **Creator**: davisj3537 (bodybuilding.com forum user)
- **Platform**: Originally posted on bodybuilding.com forums
- **Original Thread**: [Bodybuilding.com - "Fierce 5" Novice Routine](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631)
- **Level**: Beginner to early intermediate (less than 6 months of structured training)

### Description

The Fierce 5 workout program was created by bodybuilding.com forum user davisj3537, who designed it because he "wasn't completely satisfied with the majority of popular programs." He specifically cited issues with many beginner programs including slow progression, improper volume balance, and lack of what he considered proper exercise balance.

The philosophy behind Fierce 5 is to provide beginners with a simple, effective program that incorporates compound lifts for strength development alongside accessory movements for balanced muscle growth. Unlike pure strength programs (Starting Strength, StrongLifts), Fierce 5 includes more upper body volume and aesthetic-focused exercises, making it ideal for those interested in both strength and physique development.

The program consists of two workouts (A and B) performed on a rotating 3-day-per-week schedule. Each workout includes 5-6 exercises focusing on compound movements supplemented with targeted isolation work. The last exercise of each session is a superset, increasing training density and time efficiency.

Fierce 5 emphasizes progressive overload with a unique progression scheme: adding reps weekly on weeks where weight doesn't increase, then adding weight and resetting reps. This "wave" progression helps beginners develop both strength and work capacity while preventing early plateaus.

The program is designed for males who are bulking, though the creator notes that females or those cutting should take progression more slowly. It's ideal for those with less than 6 months of consistent, structured training who want a balanced approach to strength and aesthetics.

### Structure
- **Frequency**: 3 days per week (non-consecutive)
- **Split**: Rotating A/B workouts
- **Schedule Example**:
  - Week 1: Monday (A), Wednesday (B), Friday (A)
  - Week 2: Monday (B), Wednesday (A), Friday (B)
  - Repeat pattern
- **Session Duration**: 45-75 minutes
- **Program Length**: 4-6 months for bulking, can run longer with slower progression

### Session Breakdown

#### **Workout A**

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|------|------|------|-------|
| Squat | 3 | 5 | 2-3 min | Main lower body compound |
| Bench Press | 3 | 5 | 2-3 min | Main upper body push |
| Pendlay Rows | 3 | 8 | 2 min | Upper back development |
| Reverse Flyes | 3 | 10 | 90 sec | Rear delts / upper back |
| Calf Raises SS Tricep Pushdowns | 2 / 2 | 15 / 10 | Minimal | Superset - back to back |

**Total Sets: 14 sets**

**Exercise Notes**:
- **Squat**: Full depth, can be low-bar or high-bar based on preference
- **Bench Press**: Flat barbell bench, touch chest
- **Pendlay Rows**: Dead-stop rows from floor, explosive pull
- **Reverse Flyes**: Dumbbell or cable, bent-over position
- **Superset**: Complete calf raises, immediately do tricep pushdowns, then rest

#### **Workout B**

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|------|------|------|-------|
| Front Squat | 3 | 5 | 2-3 min | Quad emphasis |
| Overhead Press | 3 | 5 | 2-3 min | Shoulders (can substitute incline bench) |
| Romanian Deadlift | 3 | 8 | 2-3 min | Hip hinge pattern |
| Lat Pulldowns | 3 | 8 | 2 min | Lat width |
| Ab Work SS Curls | 2 / 2 | 15 / 10 | Minimal | Superset - back to back |

**Total Sets: 14 sets**

**Exercise Notes**:
- **Front Squat**: Barbell in front rack position, upright torso
- **Overhead Press**: Standing barbell OHP preferred; can alternate with incline bench press
- **Romanian Deadlift**: Hip hinge, slight knee bend, feel hamstring stretch
- **Lat Pulldowns**: Any grip (wide, close, neutral)
- **Ab Work**: Hanging leg raises, cable crunches, or weighted ab exercise
- **Superset**: Complete ab work, immediately do bicep curls, then rest

### Rest Periods
- **5-rep compound exercises**: 2-3 minutes
- **8-rep exercises**: 2 minutes
- **10-15 rep accessories**: 90 seconds
- **Supersets**: Minimal rest between exercises, normal rest after completing both

### Progression Scheme

Fierce 5 uses a unique **two-week progression wave**:

#### **Week 1: Add Reps**
- **5-rep exercises**: Add 1 rep per set (5 → 6)
- **8-rep exercises**: Add 2 reps per set (8 → 10)
- **10-15 rep exercises**: Add 2 reps per set (10 → 12, 15 → 17)

Example Week 1:
- Squat: 3×6
- Bench: 3×6
- Rows: 3×10

#### **Week 2: Add Weight, Reset Reps**
- **Upper body lifts** (bench, OHP, rows, pulldowns): Add 5 lbs
- **Lower body lifts** (squats, front squats, RDLs): Add 10 lbs
- **Accessories** (reverse flyes, curls, triceps, calves): Add 5 lbs
- Reset reps to original prescription

Example Week 2:
- Squat: 3×5 at 10 lbs heavier than Week 1's 3×6
- Bench: 3×5 at 5 lbs heavier than Week 1's 3×6
- Rows: 3×8 at 5 lbs heavier than Week 1's 3×10

**Progression Summary**:
- Odd weeks: Increase reps
- Even weeks: Increase weight, reset reps
- Creates a "wave loading" effect that builds work capacity

**When to Deload**:
- After 8-12 weeks of consistent progression
- If failing to complete prescribed reps for 2 consecutive sessions
- Deload = reduce weight by 10%, maintain reps for one week

**Important Notes**:
- Progression is aggressive for bulking males
- Females or those cutting should add weight every 3-4 weeks instead of 2
- Form is paramount - don't sacrifice technique for weight progression

### Program Duration

**4-6 months** for those bulking, potentially longer for slower progressions.

The program is designed as a novice routine to be run until linear progression stalls. Typical timeline:
- **Bulking males**: 4-6 months before transitioning to intermediate program
- **Cutting or females**: 6-9 months with slower progression
- **After stalling**: Transition to upper/lower split (PHUL) or other intermediate program

## Summary and Implementation Notes

### Program Comparison Matrix

| Program | Level | Days/Week | Session Length | Primary Goal | Progression Type |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Reddit PPL | Beginner | 6 | 60-90 min | Hypertrophy + Strength | Linear |
| Golden Six | Beginner | 3 | 60-90 min | Foundation Building | Linear |
| Arnold Split | Advanced | 6 | 90-150 min | Maximum Hypertrophy | Pyramid/Volume |

| Lyle GBR | Intermediate | 4 | 60-90 min | Bulking/Mass Gain | Phased Linear |
| Fierce 5 | Beginner | 3 | 45-75 min | Balanced Development | Wave Loading |

### Data Model Mapping

For implementation in the workout app, here's how these programs map to the existing data structure:

#### Plan Table
- Each program (Reddit PPL, Golden Six, etc.) = one `plan` entry
- Include description, links, program duration, and level in plan metadata

#### Session_Schedule Table
- **Reddit PPL**: 3 sessions (Pull, Push, Legs) - repeated 2x weekly
- **Golden Six**: 1 session (Full Body) - performed 3x weekly
- **Arnold Split**: 3 sessions (Chest/Back, Shoulders/Arms, Legs) - repeated 2x weekly
- **PHUL**: 4 sessions (Upper Power, Lower Power, Upper Hypertrophy, Lower Hypertrophy)
- **Lyle GBR**: 4 sessions (Lower 1, Upper 1, Lower 2, Upper 2)
- **Fierce 5**: 2 sessions (Workout A, Workout B) - alternating

#### Exercise Table
- Link base_exercise to session_schedule
- Include sets, reps, rest periods
- Note special techniques (supersets, AMRAP, pyramids) in exercise.data or description
- Use exercise_set_type for drop sets, supersets, pyramids, AMRAP

### Special Considerations

#### Supersets
- Reddit PPL: Tricep/shoulder supersets on Push day
- Fierce 5: Calf/tricep and ab/bicep supersets
- Arnold Split: Chest/back supersets throughout
- Implementation: Use `exercise_set_type = 'super-set'` with `has_subset = true`

#### AMRAP Sets
- Reddit PPL: Final set of main lifts
- Golden Six: Final set testing for progression
- Implementation: Use `exercise_set_type = 'AMRAP'`

#### Pyramid Sets
- Arnold Split: Increasing weight, decreasing reps
- Implementation: Use `exercise_set_type = 'pyramid-set'` with subset tracking

#### Progression Tracking
- Store progression rules in plan.data (JSON)
- Track linear progression limits in session_schedule.progression_limit
- Use exercise.step_increment for weight increases (2500g = 2.5kg, 5000g = 5kg)

### Missing Exercises to Implement

Based on analysis, these exercises should be added to the `base_exercise` table:

**High Priority** (used in multiple programs):
1. Pull-ups / Chin-ups
2. Barbell rows / Pendlay rows
3. Face pulls
4. Leg press
5. Leg extensions
6. Front squat
7. Tricep pushdowns
8. Cable curls
9. T-Bar rows
10. One-arm dumbbell row

**Medium Priority** (program-specific but important):
11. Dumbbell flyes
12. Cable crossovers
13. Reverse flyes
14. Hammer curls
15. Skullcrushers (lying tricep extensions)
16. Barbell lunges
17. Good mornings
18. Wrist curls / reverse wrist curls
19. Upright rows
20. Concentration curls

### Nutrition Context

Several programs specify nutritional requirements:
- **Lyle GBR**: Requires caloric surplus (0.5-1 lb/week gain)
- **Fierce 5**: Optimized for bulking males
- **Arnold Split**: Requires excellent nutrition for recovery

Consider adding nutrition recommendations to plan.description or plan.data.
