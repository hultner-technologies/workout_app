## 1. GZCL Method (GZCLP)

### Name
GZCL Method / GZCLP (General Gainz Cody Lefever Linear Progression)

### Author/Source
**Creator:** Cody Lefever, powerlifter and coach

### Description

The GZCL Method was created when powerlifter Cody Lefever needed to find a sweet spot between heavy powerlifting training and higher-volume bodybuilding work. After putting nearly 100 pounds on his total over 10 months, he analyzed his training logs and discovered consistent patterns that became the GZCL Method.

GZCLP (the linear progression variant) is designed for beginner to early intermediate lifters who want to build both strength and muscle simultaneously. The program uses a tier-based approach that intelligently balances intensity and volume across different exercise categories.

The philosophy centers on autoregulation through AMRAP (as many reps as possible) sets and built-in progression/regression schemes that adapt to your performance. This makes it highly sustainable and allows lifters to train hard while managing fatigue.

The GZCL Method is respected for its simplicity, effectiveness, and flexibility. It provides a clear framework while allowing customization based on individual needs, goals, and equipment availability.

### Structure

**Training Frequency:** 3-4 days per week
- 3-day version: A1, B1, A2 / B2, A1, B1 (alternating)
- 4-day version: A1, B1, A2, B2 (repeated)

**Three-Tier System:**
- **Tier 1 (T1):** Main compound lifts - highest intensity, lowest volume
- **Tier 2 (T2):** Secondary compounds - moderate intensity, moderate volume
- **Tier 3 (T3):** Accessory exercises - lowest intensity, highest volume

**Power vs Hypertrophy Split:**
T1 exercises focus primarily on strength development (3-5 reps), T2 provides a bridge between strength and hypertrophy (6-10 reps), and T3 targets pure hypertrophy and work capacity (15+ reps).

### Session Breakdown

#### 4-Day GZCLP Template

- **T2:** ~65-75% of 1RM (lighter than T1)
- **T3:** Light enough to complete 15+ reps (focus on muscle contraction)

**Rest Periods:**
- **T1:** 3-5 minutes between sets
- **T2:** 2-3 minutes between sets
- **T3:** 1-2 minutes between sets

### Progression

**T1 Progression:**
1. Start at 5 sets x 3 reps (volume base = 15)
2. Add 5 lbs for upper body (bench, OHP) or 10 lbs for lower body (squat, deadlift) each workout
3. When you fail to achieve volume base of 15 total reps, drop to 6 sets x 2 reps
4. Continue adding weight until volume base of 12 isn't met
5. Drop to 10 sets x 1 rep, continue adding weight
6. When you can't complete 10 singles, test new 5RM and restart at 5x3 with 85% of new 5RM

**T2 Progression:**
1. Start at 3 sets x 10 reps (volume base = 30)
2. Add 2.5-5 lbs when all sets completed successfully
3. When volume base of 30 cannot be met, drop to 3 sets x 8 reps
4. Continue progression, then drop to 3 sets x 6 reps
5. After failing at 3x6, test new 10RM and restart at 3x10 with 85% of new 10RM

**T3 Progression:**
1. Start at 3 sets x 15 reps (last set AMRAP)
2. Add weight only when you can complete 25+ reps on the AMRAP set
3. No complex progression scheme - simply add weight when ready

### Program Duration

- **Beginner lifters:** Can run 3-6 months before needing a more advanced program
- **Program cycles:** No fixed endpoint; run until linear progression stalls repeatedly
- **Deload:** Take a deload week (reduce volume/intensity by 40-50%) every 6-8 weeks or as needed

## 2. nSuns 531 LP

### Name
nSuns 5/3/1 Linear Progression

### Author/Source
**Creator:** u/nSuns (Reddit user), derived from Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 program

**Original Source:**
- Originally posted on Reddit's r/Fitness (archived)
- Community-maintained spreadsheets and documentation

### Description

nSuns 5/3/1 LP is a linear progression powerlifting program inspired by Jim Wendler's legendary 5/3/1 strength program. The program was created by Reddit user nSuns and gained massive popularity in the online fitness community for its aggressive progression and high volume approach.

Unlike traditional 5/3/1 which progresses monthly, nSuns LP advances weekly, making it suitable for late-stage novice and early intermediate lifters who can still handle frequent linear progression. This faster progression helps athletes advance more quickly than standard 5/3/1, though they will likely stall out sooner.

The program is characterized by very high volume - each workout features 9 sets of a main compound lift followed by 8 sets of a variant compound, all before accessory work begins. This makes nSuns one of the most demanding powerbuilding programs available.

nSuns 5/3/1 is ideal for lifters who have mastered basic form, can recover from high volume, and want to rapidly increase their main lifts while building significant muscle mass. The program requires dedication and good work capacity - expect 1-2 hour training sessions.

### Structure

**Training Frequency:** Available in 4-day, 5-day, and 6-day versions
- **4-day:** Best for beginners to nSuns or those with moderate recovery capacity
- **5-day:** Adds an extra upper body day (OHP/Incline focus)
- **6-day:** Squat and deadlift variants added; for advanced recovery only

**Volume Characteristics:**
- 17 sets per workout for main lifts (9 + 8) before accessories
- AMRAP sets on specific working sets for autoregulation
- High weekly volume across all main lifts

**Power vs Hypertrophy:**
The program blends both through rep ranges - main lifts use 1-8 reps with varied intensities within each session, while accessories target 8-12 reps for hypertrophy.

### Progression

**Training Max Calculation:**
- Training Max (TM) = 90% of your true 1 Rep Max
- All percentages calculated from TM, not true max

**Weekly Progression Based on AMRAP Performance:**

For the 1+ AMRAP set:
- **2-3 reps:** Increase TM by 5 lbs (2.5 kg)
- **4-5 reps:** Increase TM by 5-10 lbs (2.5-5 kg)
- **6+ reps:** Increase TM by 10-15 lbs (5-7.5 kg)

**Specific Progression Guidelines:**
- **Bench Press & OHP:** Add 5 lbs per week typically
- **Squat & Deadlift:** Add 10 lbs per week typically
- Adjust based on AMRAP performance each week

**When to Deload:**
- Every 6-7 weeks, take a deload week (reduce TM by 10%)
- If AMRAP sets consistently yield only 1-2 reps, deload
- If form breaks down significantly, deload

**When Progression Stalls:**
- Reset TM to 85-90% and rebuild
- Consider switching to 5/3/1 for Beginners or intermediate program
- Reassess recovery, nutrition, and sleep

### Program Duration

- **Typical duration:** 3-6 months before stalling
- **Weekly cycles:** Progress every week (much faster than standard 5/3/1)
- **Recommended deload:** Every 6-7 weeks
- **After stalling:** Transition to a program with slower progression (standard 5/3/1, GZCL UHF, etc.)

## 3. PHUL (Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower)

### Name
PHUL - Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower

### Author/Source
**Creator:** Brandon Campbell

**Original Source:**
- [Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) Workout - Muscle & Strength](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout)

### Description

PHUL (Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower) is a 4-day training program that combines powerlifting-style training with bodybuilding hypertrophy work in an upper/lower split. Created in 2013 by Brandon Campbell, a popular fitness YouTuber and expert, PHUL has become one of the most widely used powerbuilding programs.

The program's genius lies in its simplicity and structure. Each major muscle group is trained twice per week - once with heavy weights and low reps (power), and once with moderate weights and higher reps (hypertrophy). This dual stimulus maximizes both strength and muscle growth without overtraining.

PHUL is designed for intermediate lifters who have at least 1 year of consistent training experience and solid proficiency with compound barbell exercises. The program assumes you understand proper form and can push yourself while maintaining technique.

The program's popularity stems from its balanced approach - it's challenging enough to drive significant progress but not so demanding that recovery becomes impossible. It's perfect for lifters who want to get stronger on the big lifts while also building an aesthetic, muscular physique.

### Structure

**Training Frequency:** 4 days per week

**Weekly Split:**
- Day 1: Upper Power

## 4. PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training)

### Name
PHAT - Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training

### Author/Source
**Creator:** Dr. Layne Norton, PhD in Nutritional Sciences, professional natural bodybuilder and powerlifter

**Original Source:**
- [PHAT: Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training - Biolayne](https://biolayne.com/articles/training/phat-power-hypertrophy-adaptive-training/)
- [Download Free PHAT Program - Biolayne](https://biolayne.com/phat/)

### Description

PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) is a 5-day training program developed by Dr. Layne Norton, combining powerlifting and bodybuilding methodologies to maximize both strength and muscle growth. Dr. Norton created PHAT based on his extensive experience as both a competitive powerlifter and natural bodybuilder, along with his scientific background.

The program's innovative approach involves training each muscle group twice per week - first with heavy "power" training for strength development, then with higher-volume "hypertrophy" training for muscle growth. This dual-stimulus approach allows athletes to develop the strength of a powerlifter and the physique of a bodybuilder.

PHAT is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters who have solid training experience, good form on compound lifts, and the ability to recover from high training volumes. The program requires 5 days per week commitment and approximately 60-90 minutes per session.

What sets PHAT apart is the inclusion of "speed work" on hypertrophy days - performing the same compound exercises from power days with lighter weight (65-70%) for explosive sets of 3 reps. This bridges the gap between the two training styles and enhances power development while accumulating additional volume.

### Structure

**Training Frequency:** 5 days per week

**Weekly Split:**
- **Day 1:** Upper Body Power
- **Day 2:** Lower Body Power
- **Day 3:** Rest
- **Day 4:** Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy
- **Day 5:** Lower Body Hypertrophy
- **Day 6:** Chest and Arms Hypertrophy
- **Day 7:** Rest

**Power vs Hypertrophy Balance:**
- **Power Days (Days 1-2):** Heavy weights, 3-5 reps, 70-80% of 1RM, 3-5 min rest
- **Hypertrophy Days (Days 4-6):**
  - Speed work: 6-8 sets x 3 reps at 65-70% of power day weight, 60-90 sec rest
  - Volume work: 8-20 reps, 50-75% more volume than power days, 1-2 min rest

**Training Philosophy:**
- Hit each muscle group 2x per week with different stimuli
- Power days build maximal strength
- Hypertrophy days build muscle size and work capacity
- Speed work develops explosiveness and technique

### Progression

**Power Days (Days 1-2):**
- Add weight when you can complete all sets at the top of the rep range
- Upper body: Add 5 lbs (2.5 kg)
- Lower body: Add 10 lbs (5 kg)
- Maintain 3-5 rep range for main lifts

**Hypertrophy Days - Speed Work:**
- Keep weight at 65-70% of your power day working weight
- If power day weight increases, adjust speed work accordingly
- Focus on bar speed and explosiveness, not weight increases

**Hypertrophy Days - Volume Work:**
- Increase weight when you hit the top of the rep range for all sets
- Add 2.5-5 lbs for upper body exercises
- Add 5-10 lbs for lower body exercises
- Volume should be 50-75% higher than power days

**General Progression Guidelines:**
- Track all weights and reps
- Progressive overload on power days drives the program
- Don't ego-lift on hypertrophy days - focus on contraction quality
- If progress stalls, evaluate recovery, nutrition, and sleep first

**Deload Protocol:**
- Deload every 6-8 weeks
- Reduce volume by 50% (cut sets in half)
- Or reduce intensity by 30-40% (keep sets, reduce weight)
- Maintain movement patterns for skill retention

### Program Duration

- **Recommended cycle:** 8-12 weeks before deload or program change
- **Long-term use:** Can run for 6-12 months with periodic deloads and exercise variations
- **Beginner adaptation time:** 2-4 weeks to adapt to volume demands
- **Progression timeline:** Consistent gains typical for 3-6 months before requiring modifications

## 5. Juggernaut Method

### Name
The Juggernaut Method 2.0

### Author/Source
**Creator:** Chad Wesley Smith, professional powerlifter, founder of Juggernaut Training Systems

**Original Source:**
- Book: "The Juggernaut Method 2.0 - Strength, Speed, and Power For Every Athlete"
- [Juggernaut Training Systems](https://www.jtsstrength.com/)

### Description

The Juggernaut Method is a 16-week (4-month) periodized strength training program created by Chad Wesley Smith, one of the strongest powerlifters in the world and founder of Juggernaut Training Systems. This program represents Smith's systematic approach to building strength progressively through intelligent wave periodization.

The Juggernaut Method is unique in its structured progression through four distinct "waves" (mesocycles), each focusing on a different rep range: 10s, 8s, 5s, and 3s. Each wave lasts 4 weeks and progressively increases intensity while decreasing volume, building toward peak strength at the end of the 16-week cycle.

The program is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters who want systematic, sustainable strength gains. Rather than using fixed percentages like many programs, Juggernaut employs AMRAP (as many reps as possible) sets to autoregulate training intensity based on individual performance. This makes the program adaptable to different strength levels and recovery capacities.

What sets Juggernaut apart is its emphasis on submaximal training - avoiding excessive CNS fatigue while building work capacity and technical proficiency. The program develops strength, power, and hypertrophy simultaneously through its wave structure, making it effective for powerlifters, strength athletes, and anyone seeking long-term strength development.

### Structure

**Training Frequency:** 4 days per week

**Weekly Split:**
- Day 1: Squat Focus
- Day 2: Bench Press Focus
- Day 3: Deadlift Focus
- Day 4: Overhead Press Focus

**Wave Periodization (16 weeks total):**
- **Wave 1 (Weeks 1-4):** 10s Phase - Hypertrophy focus, build muscular base
- **Wave 2 (Weeks 5-8):** 8s Phase - Bridge between hypertrophy and strength
- **Wave 3 (Weeks 9-12):** 5s Phase - Strength development zone
- **Wave 4 (Weeks 13-16):** 3s Phase - Peak strength, highest intensity

**Weekly Structure Within Each Wave:**
- **Week 1:** Accumulation - High volume, build fatigue and work capacity
- **Week 2:** Intensification - Increase intensity, reduce volume by 50%+
- **Week 3:** Realization - Peak week, test strength adaptation
- **Week 4:** Deload - Reduce volume/intensity, prepare for next wave

**Power vs Hypertrophy:**
The program progresses from hypertrophy-dominant (10s wave) through strength-dominant (3s wave), providing balanced development across the 16-week cycle.

### Progression

**Training Max (TM) Calculation:**
- Start with 90% of your true 1RM for each lift
- Or use 105% of your proven 5RM
- All percentages in the program are based on TM, not true max

**AMRAP Set Progression:**
The program's progression is based on your performance on AMRAP sets. After each AMRAP set, adjust next wave's training max based on reps achieved:

**10s Wave AMRAP (Week 1, Day 3):**
- Minimum expected: 10 reps
- 10-12 reps: Increase TM by 5 lbs (upper body) / 10 lbs (lower body)
- 13-15 reps: Increase TM by 10 lbs (upper) / 15 lbs (lower)
- 16+ reps: Increase TM by 15 lbs (upper) / 20 lbs (lower)

**8s Wave AMRAP (Week 1, Day 3):**
- Minimum expected: 8 reps
- 8-10 reps: Increase TM by 5 lbs (upper) / 10 lbs (lower)
- 11-13 reps: Increase TM by 10 lbs (upper) / 15 lbs (lower)
- 14+ reps: Increase TM by 15 lbs (upper) / 20 lbs (lower)

**5s Wave AMRAP (Week 1, Day 3):**
- Minimum expected: 5 reps
- 5-7 reps: Increase TM by 5 lbs (upper) / 10 lbs (lower)
- 8-10 reps: Increase TM by 10 lbs (upper) / 15 lbs (lower)
- 11+ reps: Increase TM by 15 lbs (upper) / 20 lbs (lower)

**3s Wave AMRAP (Week 1, Day 3):**
- Minimum expected: 3 reps
- 3-5 reps: Increase TM by 5 lbs (upper) / 10 lbs (lower)
- 6-8 reps: Increase TM by 10 lbs (upper) / 15 lbs (lower)
- 9+ reps: Increase TM by 15 lbs (upper) / 20 lbs (lower)

**Key Progression Principles:**
- Adjustments made after each 4-week wave based on performance
- Conservative increases ensure long-term progress
- If you miss minimum reps on AMRAP, maintain current TM for next wave
- Focus on quality reps - stop AMRAP if form breaks down

### Program Duration

- **Fixed duration:** 16 weeks (one complete cycle through all four waves)
- **After completion:**
  - Option 1: Test new 1RMs and start fresh 16-week cycle with updated TMs
  - Option 2: Take 1-2 week deload and begin another cycle
  - Option 3: Transition to different program or training phase
- **Long-term use:** Can run back-to-back cycles for extended periods (6-12 months)
- **Recommended between cycles:** 1-2 week deload or active recovery

### Notes for Database Implementation

**Exercises in existing database:**
- Squat ✓
- Bench Press ✓ (listed as "Bench press")
- Deadlift ✓
- Overhead Press ✓
- Romanian Deadlift ✓ (listed as "Dumbbell romanian deadlift")

**Exercises potentially missing:**
- Front Squat
- Pause Squat
- Close-Grip Bench Press
- Incline Press (have "Incline chest press")
- Dumbbell Row
- Push Press
- Pull-Ups
- Glute-Ham Raise
- Leg Curl (have "Hamstring curl" and "Seated leg curl")

**Special Considerations:**
- Complex wave periodization requires tracking current wave and week
- Each wave has different set/rep schemes for the same exercises
- AMRAP sets need special flagging for progression calculations
- Training Max (TM) needs to be tracked separately from true 1RM (90% of 1RM)
- Percentage calculations all based on TM, not true max
- Four distinct weekly structures within each wave (Accumulation/Intensification/Realization/Deload)
- Assistance work is flexible and user-selected based on weaknesses
- 16-week program structure requires long-term planning and tracking

## Implementation Notes

### Exercise Substitutions

All programs allow exercise substitutions based on:
- Equipment availability
- Individual biomechanics and injury history
- Training preferences
- Weakness targeting

Key principle: Substitute like-for-like (compound for compound, isolation for isolation, similar movement patterns).

### Progressive Overload Principles

All programs emphasize progressive overload through:
1. **Weight increases** - Primary driver
2. **Rep increases** - Secondary driver
3. **Improved technique** - Always a focus
4. **Reduced rest periods** - Advanced technique
5. **Increased training frequency** - Program-dependent

### Recovery Considerations

Success on these programs requires:
- **Sleep:** 7-9 hours per night
- **Nutrition:** Caloric surplus or maintenance for muscle growth
- **Protein:** 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight minimum
- **Stress management:** Training is a stressor; manage life stress
- **Deloads:** Scheduled or as-needed to prevent overtraining
