### Description

Starting Strength is a novice linear progression program designed for absolute beginners to develop foundational strength using fundamental barbell movements. Created by Mark Rippetoe, a legendary strength coach and former competitive powerlifter, the program focuses on learning proper technique for the basic barbell exercises while building strength through simple, consistent progression.

The program is built around the principle that beginners can add weight to the bar every single workout session (linear progression), which works exceptionally well for novice lifters who have not yet adapted to resistance training. The philosophy emphasizes doing a few exercises very well rather than attempting to do many exercises poorly. By focusing on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, trainees develop full-body strength efficiently.

Starting Strength is designed for complete beginners with little to no barbell training experience. The program typically lasts 3-9 months depending on the trainee's age, gender, bodyweight, and recovery capacity. It's particularly effective for young males who can often progress for 6+ months, while others may graduate to intermediate programs sooner. The program is not just about lifting weights—it's an educational framework that teaches proper biomechanics and movement patterns.

**Important Note:** Starting Strength uses **3x5** (3 sets of 5 reps), not 5x5. This is a common misconception. The program was designed with 3 working sets of 5 to allow for sustainable progression without the excessive fatigue that 5x5 can cause as weights get heavy.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday or similar non-consecutive days)
- **Duration:** 3-9 months typically, until linear progression stalls repeatedly
- **Session Length:** 45-90 minutes depending on rest periods
- **Progression Scheme:** Linear progression - add weight every single workout
- **Deload Strategy:** Only deload when absolutely necessary; the program emphasizes forward progress

The program progresses through three distinct phases as the trainee advances:

### Session Breakdown

#### **Phase 1: First 2-4 Weeks (Beginner Phase)**

**Workout A:**
- Squat: 3x5 (3 working sets of 5 reps)
- Overhead Press: 3x5
- Deadlift: 1x5 (1 working set of 5 reps)

**Workout B:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Bench Press: 3x5
- Deadlift: 1x5

**Weekly Schedule:** A, B, A (Week 1) then B, A, B (Week 2), alternating

**Notes:**
- Warm-up sets not included in set counts above
- Rest periods: 3-5 minutes between sets for squats and deadlifts, 3-5 minutes for presses
- Deadlift is done for only 1 set of 5 reps due to its taxing nature

#### **Phase 2: Weeks 3-8 (Power Clean Introduction)**

**Workout A:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Overhead Press: 3x5
- Deadlift: 1x5

**Workout B:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Bench Press: 3x5
- Power Clean: 5x3 (5 sets of 3 reps)

**Notes:**
- Deadlift becomes too heavy to recover from when done every session
- Power clean replaces deadlift on Day B to develop explosive power
- Power clean uses lighter weight and focuses on technique and speed

#### **Phase 3: Intermediate Novice (Weeks 8+)**

**Workout A:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Bench Press or Overhead Press (alternating): 3x5
- Deadlift: 1x5 (every other Week A session)
- OR Power Clean: 5x3 (alternating with deadlift)

**Workout B:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Bench Press or Overhead Press (opposite of Day A): 3x5
- Chin-ups or Pull-ups: 3 sets to failure or weighted 3x5

**Notes:**
- Press exercises alternate each session (if you pressed on Monday, bench on Wednesday)
- Deadlift and power clean alternate on Day A
- Chin-ups added for additional back work

### Progression

**Weight Increments per Session:**

For most trainees:
- **Squat:** +10-15 lbs per workout initially, then +5 lbs as it gets harder
- **Deadlift:** +15-20 lbs per workout initially, then +10 lbs, then +5 lbs
- **Bench Press:** +5 lbs per workout, sometimes +2.5 lbs for lighter trainees
- **Overhead Press:** +2.5-5 lbs per workout (use microplates)
- **Power Clean:** +2.5-5 lbs per workout

**For smaller/lighter trainees or females:**
- Squat: +5 lbs per workout
- Deadlift: +10 lbs per workout
- Presses: +2.5 lbs per workout (requires 1.25 lb microplates)

**Progression Strategy:**
1. Add weight every single workout session if you complete all prescribed reps
2. If you fail to complete all reps, repeat the weight next session
3. After three consecutive failures at the same weight, you may have exhausted novice progression
4. Reset by dropping 10% off the bar and working back up with smaller jumps
5. After 2-3 resets, transition to an intermediate program

### Program Duration

- **Typical Duration:** 3-9 months
- **Young males (18-35, 180+ lbs):** 6-9 months of linear progression is common
- **Older males (40+):** 3-6 months
- **Females:** 3-6 months typically
- **Smaller/lighter individuals:** 3-6 months

The program ends when you can no longer add weight to the bar session-to-session after multiple resets.

### Equipment Requirements

**Essential:**
- Barbell (Olympic, 45 lbs / 20 kg)
- Power rack or squat stands with safety bars
- Bench (flat)
- Platform or mats for deadlifts
- Weight plates (2.5 lb, 5 lb, 10 lb, 25 lb, 45 lb recommended)

## Madcow 5x5

### Name
**Madcow 5x5 Intermediate Program** (also known as "Bill Starr 5x5 Linear Periodization")

### Author/Source
- **Original Creator:** Bill Starr (legendary strength coach, former editor of Muscle & Fitness)
- **Program Developer/Popularizer:** "Madcow" (Glenn Pendlay contributed to its popularization)
- **Based on:** Bill Starr's "The Strongest Shall Survive: Strength Training for Football" (1976)
- **Format:** Weekly linear periodization with ramped sets
- **Primary Source:** [Madcow's 5x5 Linear Version](http://www.oocities.org/elitemadcow1/5x5_Program/Linear_5x5.htm)

### Description

Madcow 5x5 is an intermediate strength program designed for lifters who have exhausted linear progression on beginner programs like Starting Strength or StrongLifts 5x5. Based on Bill Starr's original work with football players, the program was adapted and popularized online by a user known as "Madcow," who created detailed spreadsheets and documentation for the lifting community.

The fundamental philosophy is weekly linear periodization using the Heavy-Light-Medium (HLM) training approach. Unlike beginner programs where you add weight every workout, Madcow 5x5 has you add weight every week. This slower progression allows for adequate recovery between heavy training sessions, which becomes necessary for intermediate lifters whose recovery capacity can no longer keep pace with session-to-session increases.

The program uses "ramped sets" for the main lifts, meaning you progressively increase the weight across the five sets, with only the final fifth set being a true working set at maximum weight. This approach provides sufficient warm-up and neuromuscular activation while managing fatigue. The program is designed for lifters with 1-2 years of solid training experience who can no longer add weight to the bar every workout but haven't yet reached advanced status.

Madcow 5x5 is particularly effective for off-season strength development and has been successfully used by football players, powerlifters, and general strength enthusiasts. The program typically runs for 8-12 weeks before requiring a reset or transition to a different training approach.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Training Split:** Heavy-Light-Medium (HLM)
  - Monday: Volume Day (highest total workload)
  - Wednesday: Light/Recovery Day (lighter weights, active recovery)
  - Friday: Intensity Day (heaviest weights, personal records)
- **Duration:** 8-12 weeks per cycle
- **Session Length:** 60-90 minutes
- **Progression Scheme:** Weekly linear progression (add weight once per week, not per workout)
- **Deload Strategy:** Built-in lighter Wednesday session; full deload after 12 weeks or as needed

### Session Breakdown

#### **Monday - Volume Day**

**Main Lifts (Ramped Sets):**
- Squat: 5x5 ramped (e.g., 275, 305, 335, 365, 385 lbs)
- Bench Press: 5x5 ramped
- Barbell Row: 5x5 ramped

**Accessory:**
- None required (focus on main lifts)

**Rest Periods:** 3-5 minutes between sets

**Notes:**
- Ramped sets means you increase weight each set
- Only the 5th set is a "true" working set at your target weight
- Sets 1-4 serve as progressive warm-up to the top set
- This is the highest volume day of the week

#### **Wednesday - Light/Recovery Day**

**Main Lifts:**
- Squat: 4x5 at 80% of Monday's weight OR Front Squat 3x3
- Overhead Press: 4x5 ramped
- Deadlift: 4x5 ramped (or 1x5 working set)

**Accessory:**
- Optional: Face pulls, curls, or arm work

**Rest Periods:** 2-4 minutes between sets

**Notes:**
- Intentionally lighter to facilitate recovery
- Focus on technique and speed
- Should not feel exhausting
- Some variations use front squats instead of back squats

#### **Friday - Intensity Day**

**Main Lifts:**
- Squat: 4x5, 1x3, 1x8 (pyramid)
  - 4 sets of 5 reps ramped up
  - 1 set of 3 reps at your weekly PR weight (heavier than Monday's top set)
  - 1 set of 8 reps at 80% of the 3-rep set (backoff set)
- Bench Press: 4x5, 1x3, 1x8 (pyramid)
- Barbell Row: 4x5, 1x3, 1x8 (pyramid)

**Accessory:**
- Optional: Weighted dips, weighted chin-ups

**Rest Periods:** 4-7 minutes between heavy sets

**Notes:**
- This is where you set new personal records
- The 1x3 set should be heavier than anything you lifted on Monday
- The 1x8 backoff set provides additional volume at a manageable weight

### Detailed Example Week

**Week 1 - Squat Progression Example:**

*Monday:*
- Set 1: 225 lbs x 5
- Set 2: 250 lbs x 5
- Set 3: 275 lbs x 5
- Set 4: 300 lbs x 5
- Set 5: 315 lbs x 5 ← Top set

*Wednesday:*
- All sets: 245 lbs x 5 (80% of Monday's 315)

*Friday:*
- Set 1: 235 lbs x 5
- Set 2: 265 lbs x 5
- Set 3: 295 lbs x 5
- Set 4: 315 lbs x 5
- Set 5: 330 lbs x 3 ← NEW PR (heavier than Monday)
- Set 6: 265 lbs x 8 (backoff set)

### Progression

**Weekly Weight Increases:**

- **Each week**, add 2.5-5% to your top sets on Monday and Friday
- Typical increments:
  - Squat/Deadlift: +5-10 lbs per week
  - Bench Press: +2.5-5 lbs per week
  - Overhead Press: +2.5-5 lbs per week
  - Barbell Row: +2.5-5 lbs per week

**Setup Method:**

1. Determine your current 5-rep max (5RM) for each lift
2. Take 90% of your 5RM as your starting point
3. Work backward to create a 4-week ramp-up to your current 5RM
4. Continue adding weight weekly after reaching your current 5RM
5. Use a spreadsheet to calculate all weights in advance

**Example 12-Week Progression (Squat):**

- Week 1: Top set Monday 315 lbs, Friday 3RM 330 lbs
- Week 2: Top set Monday 320 lbs, Friday 3RM 335 lbs
- Week 3: Top set Monday 325 lbs, Friday 3RM 340 lbs
- ...continue adding 5 lbs per week
- Week 12: Top set Monday 370 lbs, Friday 3RM 385 lbs

**Stalling Protocol:**

- If you fail to complete Friday's target weight, repeat that week
- After 2 failures at the same weight, reduce training max by 10% and rebuild
- After 12 weeks or 2 resets, consider transitioning to a different program

### Program Duration

- **Single Cycle:** 8-12 weeks
- **Multiple Cycles:** Can be run for 2-3 cycles with deload weeks between cycles
- **Total Duration:** 6-9 months for most intermediate lifters before requiring a different approach

### Equipment Requirements

**Essential:**
- Barbell (Olympic, 45 lbs / 20 kg)
- Power rack or squat stands with safeties
- Bench (flat)
- Weight plates with small increments (2.5 lb plates essential)
- Deadlift platform or mats

**Optional:**
- Dip station or parallel bars
- Pull-up bar
- Microplates (for smaller increments on upper body lifts)

## Texas Method

### Name
**The Texas Method**

### Author/Source
- **Original Creator:** Glenn Pendlay (world-renowned weightlifting coach)
- **Documented by:** Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore
- **Book:** "Practical Programming for Strength Training" (2006, The Aasgaard Company)
- **Chapter:** Intermediate Programming chapter
- **Alternative Origin:** Rippetoe notes influence from Doug Hepburn's classic bench press workout as told by Bill Starr

### Description

The Texas Method is an intermediate barbell training program specifically designed for lifters who have exhausted the gains from linear progression programs but haven't yet reached advanced status. Created by Glenn Pendlay while coaching the Wichita Falls Weightlifting Club in the early 2000s, the program was introduced to the broader strength training community through Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore's book "Practical Programming for Strength Training."

The program is built on a brilliant weekly periodization scheme that separates volume and intensity into distinct training days. This separation allows intermediate lifters to accumulate sufficient training stress to drive adaptation while providing adequate recovery time—a balance that becomes impossible to maintain with daily linear progression. The fundamental structure is deceptively simple: Monday provides high-volume stress, Wednesday allows for active recovery with lighter weights, and Friday challenges you to set a new personal record on a heavy single set.

An interesting origin story: the program emerged when lifters in Pendlay's gym began "cheating" on their programming by doing only one heavy set of five reps on their final training day of the week instead of the prescribed five sets. When Pendlay observed that these lifters were actually making better progress, he formalized this approach into what became the Texas Method. This exemplifies how practical coaching experience can lead to program innovations.

The Texas Method is ideal for lifters who have been training consistently for 6-18 months, have maxed out beginner gains, and can squat at least 1.5x bodyweight. The program emphasizes weekly personal records and requires excellent recovery practices including adequate sleep, nutrition, and stress management.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday/Saturday)
- **Training Split:** Volume-Light-Intensity (VLI)
  - Monday: Volume Day (5x5 at submaximal weight)
  - Wednesday: Light/Recovery Day (varied lighter work)
  - Friday: Intensity Day (1x5 PR attempt)
- **Duration:** Can be run for 6-12+ months for intermediate lifters
- **Session Length:** 60-120 minutes (Monday longest, Wednesday shortest)
- **Progression Scheme:** Weekly progression on the intensity day
- **Deload Strategy:** Lighter Wednesday work serves as active recovery; full deload every 6-8 weeks or as needed

### Session Breakdown

#### **Monday - Volume Day**

**Main Lifts:**
- Squat: 5x5 at ~90% of Friday's weight (or ~85% of 5RM)
- Bench Press OR Overhead Press: 5x5 at ~90% of Friday's weight
- Deadlift: 1x5 (every other week) OR Power Clean 5x3

**Accessory (Optional):**
- Back extensions: 3x10
- Glute-ham raises: 3x10
- Chin-ups: 3x8-10

**Rest Periods:** 5-7 minutes between squat sets, 3-5 minutes for other lifts

**Notes:**
- This is the highest volume day - you'll accumulate significant fatigue
- Use approximately 90% of the weight you'll attempt on Friday
- Focus on quality reps and technique
- Should feel challenging but not like maximal effort
- Total workout time: 90-120 minutes with adequate rest

#### **Wednesday - Light/Recovery Day**

**Option 1 (Light Back Squat):**
- Squat: 3x3 at 75-80% of Monday's weight (or 2x5 at 80%)
- Overhead Press OR Bench Press (opposite of Monday): 3x5 at light weight
- Chin-ups or Pull-ups: 3x8-10
- Back extensions: 3x10

**Option 2 (Front Squat Variant):**
- Front Squat: 3x3 at 70-75% of back squat
- Light Press work: 3x5
- Assistance work as desired

**Option 3 (Active Recovery):**
- Squat: 2x5 at 60-70% of Monday's weight (focus on speed)
- Light pressing: 3x5
- Stretching and mobility work

**Rest Periods:** 2-3 minutes

**Notes:**
- This day should NOT be taxing
- Focus on technique, speed, and movement quality
- Should leave the gym feeling refreshed, not fatigued
- Total workout time: 45-60 minutes
- Some lifters prefer front squats for reduced lower back stress

#### **Friday/Saturday - Intensity Day**

**Main Lifts:**
- Squat: Warm-up, then 1x5 at new 5RM PR (or 1x3, or 1x1 depending on phase)
- Bench Press OR Overhead Press: 1x5 PR (alternates with Monday)
- Deadlift: 1x5 PR (every other week, alternates with Monday) OR Power Clean 5x3 at moderate weight

**Accessory:**
- Optional: Light back work or arms
- Keep accessories minimal to prioritize recovery from heavy work

**Rest Periods:** Take as much rest as needed before PR sets (10-15 minutes not uncommon)

**Notes:**
- This is where you set new personal records every week
- Warm up thoroughly with progressive singles or doubles
- The single set of 5 should be a true maximal effort for that day
- If you successfully complete the 5 reps, add weight next week
- If you fail, repeat the same weight or adjust training loads
- Total workout time: 60-90 minutes including thorough warm-up

### Detailed Example Week

**Week 1 - Squat Example (Current 5RM: 335 lbs):**

*Monday:*
- Squat: 5x5 @ 300 lbs (90% of Friday's planned 335)
- Bench Press: 5x5 @ 200 lbs
- Deadlift: 1x5 @ 365 lbs

*Wednesday:*
- Front Squat: 3x3 @ 225 lbs
- Overhead Press: 3x5 @ 115 lbs
- Chin-ups: 3x10

*Friday:*
- Squat: 1x5 @ 335 lbs (current 5RM)
- Bench Press: 1x5 @ 225 lbs (new PR)
- Power Clean: 5x3 @ 155 lbs

**Week 2 - Progressive Overload:**

*Monday:*
- Squat: 5x5 @ 305 lbs (90% of Friday's planned 340)
- Overhead Press: 5x5 @ 120 lbs
- (No deadlift this week)

*Wednesday:*
- Back Squat: 2x5 @ 225 lbs (light, 75% of Monday)
- Bench Press: 3x5 @ 185 lbs (light)
- Pull-ups: 3x10

*Friday:*
- Squat: 1x5 @ 340 lbs (NEW 5RM - added 5 lbs)
- Overhead Press: 1x5 @ 125 lbs (new PR)
- Deadlift: 1x5 @ 370 lbs (new PR)

### Progression

**Weekly Progression Guidelines:**

1. **Setup:** Establish current true 5-rep maxes for squat, bench, press, and deadlift
2. **Monday Volume:** Use 90% of Friday's planned weight for 5x5
3. **Friday Intensity:** Attempt to add weight to your 5RM every week
   - Squat: +5 lbs per week
   - Deadlift: +5-10 lbs per week
   - Bench Press: +2.5-5 lbs per week
   - Overhead Press: +2.5 lbs per week

**Progression Phases:**

As you advance on the Texas Method, you may need to modify the rep scheme on intensity day:

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** 1x5 PR on intensity day
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Transition to 1x3 PR on intensity day as 5RM progress slows
- **Phase 3 (Months 7+):** May transition to 1x1 or 2x2 for continued progress

**Adjusting Volume Day:**

- Monday's volume should be ~90% of Friday's weight initially
- As you get stronger, you may need to reduce to 85% or even 80% to recover adequately
- Some advanced trainees reduce to 3x5 or even 3x3 on Monday

**Stalling and Resets:**

- If you fail Friday's PR attempt, repeat the same weight next week
- If you fail the same weight 2 weeks in a row, reduce Monday's volume by 5-10%
- If you fail 3 weeks in a row, reduce both Monday and Friday loads by 10% and rebuild
- Consider a deload week after 8-12 weeks of continuous progression

### Program Duration

- **Typical Duration:** 6-18 months for most intermediate lifters
- **Minimum:** 3-6 months to see substantial benefits
- **Maximum:** Some lifters successfully run variations for 2+ years
- **Transition Indicator:** When weekly PRs are no longer sustainable even with resets

### Equipment Requirements

**Essential:**
- Barbell (Olympic, 45 lbs / 20 kg)
- Power rack with adjustable safeties (essential for heavy single sets)
- Bench (flat)
- Platform or mats for deadlifts
- Full plate set with 2.5 lb increments
- Microplates (1.25 lb) for press progression

**Highly Recommended:**

### Description

Wendler 5/3/1 is a percentage-based strength training program built on monthly progression cycles and submaximal training. Created by Jim Wendler, a former elite powerlifter and strength coach, the program was born from Wendler's frustration with overly complex programs and the realization that simple, sustainable progress beats chasing maximal lifts constantly. The philosophy emphasizes "start light, progress slowly" and "train, don't test."

The program is built around four main lifts performed once per week each: squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press. Unlike programs that have you constantly working at your limits, 5/3/1 uses a "training max" (90% of your true 1-rep max) to calculate all working weights. This built-in submaximal approach ensures you accumulate quality reps and volume without burning out or risking injury from constantly grinding near-maximal loads.

The name "5/3/1" refers to the rep scheme across the three main working weeks of each 4-week cycle: Week 1 uses sets of 5+ reps, Week 2 uses sets of 3+ reps, Week 3 uses sets of 5/3/1+ reps, and Week 4 is a deload. The "+" indicates AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) sets, where you push beyond the prescribed reps to drive progress and test strength without the need for frequent max testing.

Wendler 5/3/1 is suitable for intermediate to advanced lifters, athletes looking to build strength while maintaining conditioning, and even beginners using the "5/3/1 for Beginners" variation. The program has spawned numerous variations (Boring But Big, Building the Monolith, etc.) but the original remains the foundation. It can be run indefinitely with proper cycling and is known for producing slow, steady, sustainable strength gains.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 4 days per week (can be adapted to 3 days)
- **Training Split:** Each main lift trained once per week
  - Day 1: Overhead Press + assistance
  - Day 2: Deadlift + assistance
  - Day 3: Bench Press + assistance
  - Day 4: Squat + assistance
- **Duration:** Runs in 4-week cycles indefinitely
- **Session Length:** 45-90 minutes depending on assistance work
- **Progression Scheme:** Monthly progression based on training max increases
- **Deload Strategy:** Built-in deload every 4th week (Week 4 of each cycle)

**Typical Weekly Schedule:**
- Monday: Overhead Press
- Tuesday: Deadlift
- Thursday: Bench Press
- Friday: Squat
- OR adapt to your schedule (just maintain 4 sessions per week)

### Session Breakdown

#### **Calculating Your Training Max**

Before starting, you need to establish your Training Max (TM) for each lift:

1. Test or estimate your current 1-rep max (1RM)
2. Calculate Training Max: **TM = 0.90 × 1RM**
3. All percentages in the program are based on this TM, not your true max

**Example:**
- True 1RM Squat: 400 lbs
- Training Max: 400 × 0.90 = 360 lbs
- All working percentages calculated from 360 lbs

#### **Week 1: 5+ Week**

**Set Structure (for each main lift):**
- Warm-up: 5 reps @ 40% TM, 5 reps @ 50% TM, 3 reps @ 60% TM
- Working Set 1: 5 reps @ 65% TM
- Working Set 2: 5 reps @ 75% TM
- Working Set 3: **5+ reps @ 85% TM** (AMRAP - as many reps as possible)

**Example - Overhead Press (TM = 180 lbs):**
- Warm-up: 72 lbs × 5, 90 lbs × 5, 108 lbs × 3
- Set 1: 117 lbs × 5
- Set 2: 135 lbs × 5
- Set 3: 153 lbs × 5+ (shoot for 8-12 reps)

**Assistance Work:**
- Push: 50-100 total reps (dips, push-ups, tricep work)
- Pull: 50-100 total reps (rows, chin-ups, face pulls)
- Single-leg/Core: 0-50 total reps

#### **Week 2: 3+ Week**

**Set Structure (for each main lift):**
- Warm-up: 5 reps @ 40% TM, 5 reps @ 50% TM, 3 reps @ 60% TM
- Working Set 1: 3 reps @ 70% TM
- Working Set 2: 3 reps @ 80% TM
- Working Set 3: **3+ reps @ 90% TM** (AMRAP)

**Example - Deadlift (TM = 450 lbs):**
- Warm-up: 180 lbs × 5, 225 lbs × 5, 270 lbs × 3
- Set 1: 315 lbs × 3
- Set 2: 360 lbs × 3
- Set 3: 405 lbs × 3+ (shoot for 5-8 reps)

**Assistance Work:** Same as Week 1

#### **Week 3: 5/3/1+ Week**

**Set Structure (for each main lift):**
- Warm-up: 5 reps @ 40% TM, 5 reps @ 50% TM, 3 reps @ 60% TM
- Working Set 1: 5 reps @ 75% TM
- Working Set 2: 3 reps @ 85% TM
- Working Set 3: **1+ reps @ 95% TM** (AMRAP)

**Example - Bench Press (TM = 315 lbs):**
- Warm-up: 126 lbs × 5, 158 lbs × 5, 189 lbs × 3
- Set 1: 236 lbs × 5
- Set 2: 268 lbs × 3
- Set 3: 299 lbs × 1+ (shoot for 3-6 reps)

**Assistance Work:** Same as Week 1

**Notes:**
- This is the heaviest week
- The AMRAP set at 95% TM is very challenging
- Don't go to absolute failure on AMRAP sets; leave 1 rep in the tank

#### **Week 4: Deload Week**

**Set Structure (for each main lift):**
- Warm-up: As normal
- Working Set 1: 5 reps @ 40% TM
- Working Set 2: 5 reps @ 50% TM
- Working Set 3: 5 reps @ 60% TM

**Assistance Work:** Minimal or none; focus on recovery

**Notes:**
- This week should feel very easy
- Purpose is active recovery and preparation for the next cycle
- Resist the urge to add weight or reps
- Some lifters skip this week, but Wendler recommends keeping it

### Detailed 4-Week Cycle Example

**Squat Cycle (Training Max: 360 lbs):**

| Week | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 (AMRAP) |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | 234 lbs × 5 | 270 lbs × 5 | 306 lbs × 5+ |
| 2 | 252 lbs × 3 | 288 lbs × 3 | 324 lbs × 3+ |
| 3 | 270 lbs × 5 | 306 lbs × 3 | 342 lbs × 1+ |
| 4 | 144 lbs × 5 | 180 lbs × 5 | 216 lbs × 5 |

After Week 4, increase Training Max and begin new cycle.

### Progression

**End of Each 4-Week Cycle:**

After completing Week 4 (deload), increase your Training Max for the next cycle:
- **Squat:** +5-10 lbs
- **Deadlift:** +5-10 lbs
- **Bench Press:** +2.5-5 lbs
- **Overhead Press:** +2.5-5 lbs

**AMRAP Set as Progress Indicator:**

The AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) final set of each workout tells you how you're progressing:
- **Week 1 (85% TM):** Should get 8-12+ reps
- **Week 2 (90% TM):** Should get 5-8+ reps
- **Week 3 (95% TM):** Should get 3-6+ reps

If you're getting fewer reps than these ranges, your Training Max might be too high.

**Cycling and Resetting:**

- Run cycles continuously, adding weight after each 4-week cycle
- After 3-4 cycles (12-16 weeks), consider a reset
- To reset: Reduce Training Max by 10%, start new cycle with lighter weights
- The "7th Week Protocol" is an optional testing week every 2-3 cycles

**Long-Term Progression Example:**

- **Cycle 1:** TM 360 lbs → Increase to 370 lbs
- **Cycle 2:** TM 370 lbs → Increase to 380 lbs
- **Cycle 3:** TM 380 lbs → Increase to 390 lbs
- **Reset:** Drop to TM 350 lbs and rebuild (still stronger than when you started)

### Program Duration

- **Minimum:** One cycle (4 weeks) - but this defeats the purpose
- **Recommended:** 3-6 cycles (12-24 weeks) minimum
- **Typical:** Can be run indefinitely with proper resets
- **Many lifters:** Run variations of 5/3/1 for years

The beauty of 5/3/1 is that it's designed to be a long-term training philosophy, not a short-term program.

### Popular Variations

While this document focuses on the original 5/3/1, several popular variations exist:

- **5/3/1 for Beginners:** Squat and bench twice per week
- **Boring But Big (BBB):** Adds 5x10 supplemental work after main lifts
- **Building the Monolith:** High-volume variation for size
- **5/3/1 Triumvirate:** Specific assistance template
- **FSL (First Set Last):** Repeat first working set for 5x5 after main work

### Equipment Requirements

**Essential:**
- Barbell (Olympic, 45 lbs / 20 kg)
- Power rack or squat stands
- Bench (flat)
- Weight plates including 2.5 lb plates (fractional plates helpful)
- Pull-up bar or lat pulldown

**Recommended:**
- Dip station
- Variety of dumbbells
- Bands for assistance
- Platform for deadlifts

## Smolov Program

### Name
**Smolov Squat Routine** (also known as "Smolov Base Mesocycle" or simply "Smolov")

### Author/Source
- **Author:** Sergey Smolov (Russian Master of Sports)
- **Origin:** Soviet/Russian weightlifting and powerlifting programs
- **Popularized:** Early 2000s through internet lifting communities
- **Primary Focus:** Squat specialization
- **Variants:** Smolov Jr. (3-week condensed version)

### Description

The Smolov Squat Routine is a notoriously brutal 13-week squat specialization program designed to add massive amounts of weight to your squat in a short period. Created by Russian Master of Sports Sergey Smolov, this program emerged from Soviet-era strength training methods known for their extreme volume and intensity. The program promises gains of 80-100 pounds on your squat max in just 13 weeks—gains that would normally take a year or more with conventional programming.

Smolov is not a balanced full-body strength program. It is squat-focused peaking cycle that places squatting at the absolute center of your training with everything else taking a back seat. The program structure involves squatting 4 days per week during the most intense phases, with weekly rep counts reaching an astounding 136 reps in the base mesocycle. This volume is significantly higher than any other mainstream program and requires extraordinary recovery capacity.

The program is infamous for its difficulty and dropout rate. It is physically and mentally exhausting, requiring perfect recovery conditions: optimal nutrition (often 4000+ calories per day), 8-10 hours of sleep nightly, minimal life stress, and ideally no other physically demanding activities. Many coaches openly state that Smolov is designed for athletes using performance-enhancing drugs and should only be attempted by advanced to elite lifters with multiple years of serious training.

Despite its reputation for difficulty, thousands of lifters have successfully completed Smolov and achieved remarkable squat gains. However, many have also suffered injuries, burnout, or failed to complete the program. The program requires total commitment and is not recommended for intermediate lifters, anyone with a demanding job or lifestyle, or those training for general fitness. This is a program for competitive powerlifters and serious strength athletes willing to make squatting their primary life focus for 13 weeks.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3-4 days per week depending on phase
- **Total Duration:** 13 weeks
- **Phases:** 5 distinct phases with different characteristics
- **Session Length:** 60-90 minutes (mostly squatting)
- **Progression Scheme:** Prescribed weights increase weekly within each phase
- **Deload Strategy:** Switching phase (weeks 7-8) serves as active recovery; taper in week 13

**Program Phases:**

1. **Introduction Microcycle (Weeks 1-2):** 3 days/week preparation
2. **Base Mesocycle (Weeks 3-6):** 4 days/week, extremely high volume
3. **Switching Phase (Weeks 7-8):** 3 days/week, lighter recovery work
4. **Intense Mesocycle (Weeks 9-12):** 3 days/week, very heavy weights
5. **Taper Week (Week 13):** 2 light sessions + 1RM test

### Session Breakdown

#### **Phase 1: Introduction Microcycle (Weeks 1-2)**

**Purpose:** Prepare your body for the upcoming volume

**Training Schedule:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

**Week 1:**
- Day 1: 3x8 @ 65%, 1x5 @ 70%, 2x2 @ 75%, 1x1 @ 80%
- Day 2: 1x5 @ 80%, 1x7 @ 75%, 1x10 @ 70%, 1x8 @ 75%
- Day 3: 4x5 @ 65%, 1x3 @ 70%, 2x2 @ 75%, 1x1 @ 80%

**Week 2:**
- Day 1: 1x5 @ 80%, 1x7 @ 75%, 1x10 @ 70%, 1x8 @ 75%
- Day 2: 4x5 @ 70%, 1x5 @ 75%
- Day 3: 1x5 @ 75%, 1x10 @ 70%, 1x8 @ 75%

**Notes:**
- All percentages based on current 1RM
- Should feel manageable, not exhausting
- Focus on technique and movement quality

#### **Phase 2: Base Mesocycle (Weeks 3-6) - THE BRUTAL PHASE**

**Purpose:** Build massive squat volume tolerance and work capacity

**Training Schedule:** 4 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday)

**IMPORTANT:** This is the most infamous part of Smolov. You will squat 4 days per week with total weekly volume of ~136 reps.

**Weekly Pattern (repeated for 4 weeks with progressive overload):**

**Day 1 (Monday):**
- 4x9 @ 70% + weekly increment

**Day 2 (Wednesday):**
- 5x7 @ 75% + weekly increment

**Day 3 (Friday):**
- 7x5 @ 80% + weekly increment

**Day 4 (Saturday):**
- 10x3 @ 85% + weekly increment

**Weekly Weight Increases:**
- Week 3 to 4: Add 20 lbs
- Week 4 to 5: Add 10-20 lbs
- Week 5 to 6: Add 10 lbs

**Example Week 3 (assuming 1RM = 405 lbs):**
- Monday: 4x9 @ 283 lbs (70%)
- Wednesday: 5x7 @ 304 lbs (75%)
- Friday: 7x5 @ 324 lbs (80%)
- Saturday: 10x3 @ 344 lbs (85%)
- **Total Reps: 136**

**Rest Periods:** 2-4 minutes between sets minimum

**Notes:**
- This phase breaks most lifters
- Eat massive amounts of food (500+ calorie surplus)
- Sleep 8-10 hours minimum
- Minimize all other training
- Week 6 is the hardest week of the program
- If you can't keep up, drop out rather than risk injury

#### **Phase 3: Switching Phase (Weeks 7-8)**

**Purpose:** Active recovery before the intense mesocycle

**Training Schedule:** 3-4 days per week

**Focus:**
- Speed squats with lighter weights (50-60% 1RM)
- Accessory work: deadlifts, hamstring work, back work
- Dynamic effort training
- Allow nervous system and muscles to recover

**Example Week 7:**
- Day 1: Speed Squats 10x3 @ 50-60% (focus on bar speed)
- Day 2: Deadlift variation 5x5
- Day 3: Speed Squats 10x3 @ 50-60%

**Notes:**
- This should feel refreshing after the base mesocycle
- Don't add extra volume—stick to the plan
- Your body is recovering and adapting

#### **Phase 4: Intense Mesocycle (Weeks 9-12)**

**Purpose:** Peak strength development with heavy weights

**Training Schedule:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

**Weekly Pattern (repeated with progression):**

**Day 1 (Monday):**
- 1x3 @ 65%, 1x4 @ 75%, 1x3 @ 85%, 1x2 @ 90%, 1x4 @ 95%
- 1x2 @ 100%, 1x2 @ 105%, 1x1 @ 110%

**Day 2 (Wednesday):**
- 1x3 @ 60%, 1x3 @ 70%, 1x4 @ 80%, 1x5 @ 90%

**Day 3 (Friday):**
- 1x4 @ 65%, 1x4 @ 70%, 1x5 @ 75%, 1x3 @ 80%
- 1x3 @ 90%, 1x3 @ 95%, 1x5 @ 100%

**Notes:**
- Percentages now based on NEW 1RM estimate from Week 6
- These are very heavy weights
- Requires maximal mental focus
- Monday is the heaviest day
- Perfect technique is crucial to avoid injury

**Progression:**
- Each week adds 10-20 lbs to the working sets
- Week 12 should have you handling weights near or above your old max for reps

#### **Phase 5: Taper and Test (Week 13)**

**Purpose:** Reduce fatigue and test new 1RM

**Day 1 (Monday):**
- 1x3 @ 50%, 1x3 @ 60%, 1x3 @ 70%

**Day 2 (Wednesday):**
- 1x3 @ 50%, 1x2 @ 60%, 1x2 @ 70%

**Day 3 (Friday or Saturday):**
- **1RM TEST DAY**
- Warm up progressively
- Work up to new 1-rep max
- Should see 80-100 lb increase over starting max

**Notes:**
- First two days should feel very easy
- Eat well, sleep well leading up to test day
- Warm up thoroughly on test day
- Be conservative with jumps—you have one shot

### Progression

**Built-in Progression:**

Unlike other programs where you decide how much weight to add, Smolov prescribes exact progression:

**Base Mesocycle:**
- Week 3: Use percentages of current 1RM
- Week 4: Add 20 lbs to all working weights
- Week 5: Add another 10-20 lbs
- Week 6: Add another 10 lbs

**Intense Mesocycle:**
- Use new estimated 1RM from end of base cycle
- Add 10-20 lbs each week to working weights
- Week 12 should have you handling previous max for multiple reps

**Expected Gains:**

If completed successfully:
- **Minimum gain:** 40-50 lbs on squat 1RM
- **Typical gain:** 60-80 lbs
- **Exceptional gain:** 80-100+ lbs
- **Beginner advantage:** Less trained lifters may see larger absolute gains

### Program Duration

- **Total Duration:** 13 weeks (91 days)
- **Cannot be shortened:** Each phase serves a specific purpose
- **Cannot be extended:** The program is designed as a peaking cycle
- **Recovery After:** Take 1-2 weeks of light training after completion

**Smolov Jr. (Alternative):**

For those who want something less extreme:
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Schedule:** 4 days per week
- **Purpose:** Can be used for squat OR bench press
- **Gains:** 20-40 lbs typically
- **Can be repeated:** After 1 week deload

### Who Should NOT Attempt Smolov

**Do NOT attempt this program if you:**

- Have less than 2-3 years of serious barbell training
- Cannot squat at least 1.5x bodyweight

### Evidence Base

Smolov's effectiveness (and controversy) is based on:

1. **Soviet Training Methods:** Emerged from Russian strength training systems with decades of athletic success
2. **Extreme Volume:** Uses volume levels proven to drive adaptation when recovery is adequate
3. **Documented Results:** Thousands of documented cases of 80-100 lb squat increases
4. **Specialization:** Squat-only focus allows for concentrated adaptation
5. **Peaking Cycle Design:** Structured as a true peaking program with progressive overload and taper
6. **High-Level Usage:** Successfully used by competitive powerlifters and weightlifters
7. **Honest Limitations:** Respected coaches acknowledge it's designed for enhanced athletes
8. **Dropout Rate:** The 30-50% dropout rate actually validates how challenging it is

**Important Context:**

- Many strength coaches consider this program excessive for natural athletes
- The program's designer likely assumed pharmaceutical enhancement
- Success requires near-perfect recovery conditions
- Risk of injury is significantly higher than other programs
- Not suitable for general strength development
- Should only be used as a peaking cycle, not year-round training

The program is respected for its effectiveness under the right conditions but criticized for being unnecessarily extreme for most lifters. Many coaches recommend less brutal alternatives unless you're a competitive powerlifter with specific peaking needs.

**Program-Specific Features Needed:**

1. **Percentage Calculator:** For Wendler 5/3/1 and Smolov (calculate working weights from training max)
2. **AMRAP Tracking:** For Wendler 5/3/1 (track reps achieved on + sets)
3. **Cycle Tracking:** Mark which week/cycle user is on
4. **Deload Scheduling:** Auto-schedule deload weeks for programs that require them
5. **Progressive Overload Calculator:** Auto-calculate weight increases based on program rules

### User Experience Considerations

- Provide clear warnings about program difficulty (especially for Smolov)
- Include experience level recommendations for each program
- Link to original sources and form videos
- Allow users to input training max or 1RM and auto-calculate all working weights
- Provide progress tracking to show strength gains over time
- Include built-in deload scheduling
- Warn users when attempting to skip sessions or deviate from program structure
