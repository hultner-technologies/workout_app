### Description

StrongLifts 5×5 is one of the most popular beginner strength training programs, with a history spanning over 65 years. The program is designed to build foundational strength through simple, compound barbell movements performed with high volume (5 sets of 5 reps).

The program's core philosophy is progressive overload achieved through linear progression. Every workout, you incrementally increase the weight by a small amount (typically 2.5-5 pounds) when you successfully complete all sets and reps. This simple approach ensures consistent strength gains for beginners who have not yet adapted to heavy resistance training.

StrongLifts 5x5 is ideal for complete beginners who want a straightforward, no-nonsense approach to getting stronger. The program requires only a barbell, plates, a rack, and a bench. The focus is entirely on the five fundamental compound lifts that build total body strength: squat, bench press, overhead press, barbell row, and deadlift.

The program emphasizes proper form and gradual progression over rushing to lift heavy weights. Beginners start with light weights (even just the empty barbell for some exercises) to master technique before adding significant load. This approach minimizes injury risk while building the habit of consistent training.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (typically Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Rest:** At least one full day of rest between workouts
- **Duration per workout:** 45-60 minutes
- **Program type:** Full body, alternating workouts

### Session Breakdown

The program alternates between two workouts (A and B) throughout the week.

**Week 1 Example:** Monday (A), Wednesday (B), Friday (A)
**Week 2 Example:** Monday (B), Wednesday (A), Friday (B)

#### Workout A
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Squat** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes |
| **Bench Press** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes |
| **Barbell Row** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes |

#### Workout B
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Squat** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes |
| **Overhead Press** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes |
| **Deadlift** | 1 × 5 | N/A |

**Note:** Squats are performed every workout. Deadlifts are only performed for 1 set of 5 reps (not 5x5) due to their high systemic fatigue.

### Progression

**Linear Progression:**
- Add **5 lbs (2.5 kg)** to upper body lifts (Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Row) each successful workout
- Add **10 lbs (5 kg)** to lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift) each successful workout
- Only increase weight when you complete all prescribed sets and reps with proper form

**Monthly progression example:**
- Squat and Deadlift: +60 lbs (27 kg) per month
- Bench Press, Overhead Press, and Row: +30 lbs (13.5 kg) per month

### Starting Weights

**For complete beginners (never lifted before):**
- Squat: 45 lbs (20 kg) - empty barbell
- Bench Press: 45 lbs (20 kg) - empty barbell
- Overhead Press: 45 lbs (20 kg) - empty barbell
- Barbell Row: 65 lbs (30 kg)
- Deadlift: 95 lbs (40 kg)

**For experienced lifters returning to training:**
- Start with 50% of your 5-rep max
- Or use a weight you can comfortably lift for 10 reps

The first few weeks should feel easy. This allows you to focus on perfecting form before the weights become challenging.

### Rest Periods

- **3 minutes** if the previous set felt challenging but doable
- **5 minutes** if you struggled to complete 5 reps on the previous set
- Less rest (1.5-3 minutes) is acceptable during the early weeks when weights are light

Proper rest is critical for recovery between sets and maintaining performance across all 5 sets.

### Deload/Stall Protocol

**When to deload:**
- If you fail to complete 5×5 for the same weight three workouts in a row

**How to deload:**
- Reduce the weight by 10%
- Focus on perfecting form at the lighter weight
- Resume adding weight using the normal progression (5 lbs or 10 lbs per workout)
- This allows you to work back up with better form and often break through previous plateaus

**Example:** If you fail 225 lbs squat three times in a row, deload to 205 lbs (225 × 0.9) and work back up.

### Program Duration

- **Recommended duration:** 12-16 weeks for most beginners
- Continue until linear progression stalls repeatedly (multiple deloads on multiple lifts)
- After completing StrongLifts 5x5, transition to an intermediate program like Madcow 5×5, Texas Method, or 5/3/1

### Evidence Base

StrongLifts 5x5 is recommended for beginners because:

1. **Simplicity:** Only 5 exercises to learn, reducing overwhelm for novices
2. **Progressive Overload:** Consistent weekly increases drive rapid strength gains in untrained individuals
3. **Compound Movements:** All exercises are multi-joint movements that build functional strength
4. **Optimal Frequency:** Training each movement pattern 1.5-3 times per week provides sufficient stimulus and recovery for beginners
5. **Established Track Record:** Variations of 5×5 training have been used successfully since the 1960s (Bill Starr's 5×5)
6. **Form Emphasis:** Starting light allows beginners to master technique before handling heavy weights

## Greyskull LP

### Name
**Greyskull Linear Progression (Greyskull LP or GSLP)**

### Author/Source
Created by John Sheaffer, also known as "Johnny Pain," a former paratrooper and strength coach.

**Links:**
- [Greyskull LP Spreadsheet - Lift Vault](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/greyskull-linear-progression-spreadsheet/)
- [PowerliftingToWin Greyskull LP Review](https://www.powerliftingtowin.com/greyskull-lp/)
- [Outlift Greyskull LP Analysis](https://outlift.com/greyskull-lp/)

### Description

Greyskull LP is a powerbuilding program (strength + hypertrophy) designed by John Sheaffer after experimenting with Starting Strength and wanting to improve upon it. The program takes a unique approach to linear progression by incorporating AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) sets, which allow for additional volume and better hypertrophy stimulus compared to straight 5×5 programs.

The core philosophy of Greyskull LP is "frequency method" training combined with autoregulation through AMRAP sets. Unlike programs that prescribe fixed volume (like 5×5), Greyskull LP allows lifters to push beyond the minimum reps on their final set, providing a built-in way to accumulate extra volume on good days.

Greyskull LP is ideal for beginners who want to build both strength and muscle mass (powerbuilding). It's particularly well-suited for those who find pure strength programs too low in volume or who want more upper body development. The program's flexibility through AMRAP sets makes it more adaptable to individual recovery and progression rates.

The program emphasizes balanced development through equal emphasis on pressing and pulling movements. This differs from some other beginner programs that may neglect pulling volume, which can lead to muscular imbalances and poor posture over time.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week
- **Rest:** At least one full day of rest between workouts
- **Duration per workout:** 45-60 minutes
- **Program type:** Full body, alternating workouts
- **Set scheme:** 2 sets of 5 reps, then 1 AMRAP set (notated as 2×5, 1×5+)

### Session Breakdown

The program alternates between two workouts throughout the week. The original Greyskull LP includes assistance work (curls, neck harness, weighted chins) between the main lifts.

#### Workout A
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Bench Press** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP on last set |
| **Curl** | 2 × 10-15 | 2-3 minutes | Assistance work |
| **Squat** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP on last set |

#### Workout B
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Overhead Press** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP on last set |
| **Weighted Chin-ups** | 2 × 6-8 | 2-3 minutes | Only if BW chins are mastered |
| **Deadlift** | 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP set only |

**Optional additions:** Neck harness work, additional arm work

**Week example:**
- Monday: Workout A
- Wednesday: Workout B
- Friday: Workout A
- Next Monday: Workout B (alternating)

### Progression

**Linear Progression:**
- Add **2.5 lbs** to upper body pressing movements (Bench Press, Overhead Press) each workout
- Add **5 lbs** to lower body movements (Squat, Deadlift) each workout
- Add **2.5 lbs** to curls when you hit the top of the rep range

**AMRAP Acceleration:**
- If you hit **10 or more reps** on your AMRAP set, **double** the weight increase next workout
- Example: If you get 5, 5, 12 on bench press at 135 lbs, add 5 lbs (instead of 2.5 lbs) next session

This autoregulation feature allows stronger or more recovered lifters to progress faster when they're ready.

### Starting Weights

Start with weights that allow you to comfortably perform the prescribed sets and get at least 5 reps on the AMRAP set.

**General guidelines:**
- Use a weight that represents approximately 65-75% of your estimated 5-rep max
- The first AMRAP set should yield 7-10 reps
- Start conservative to allow room for progression

### Rest Periods

- **Main lifts (Squat, Bench, OHP, Deadlift):** 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Assistance work (Curls, Chins):** 2-3 minutes between sets
- Adjust based on recovery and performance

### Deload/Stall Protocol

**Reset Protocol:**
- When reps on the AMRAP set fall below 5, it's time to reset
- **Deload:** Take 10% off the bar for that specific lift
- Resume progression from the reduced weight
- Only deload the lift that has stalled; continue progressing on other lifts

**Example:** If you get 5, 5, 4 on squats at 225 lbs, reset to 205 lbs (225 × 0.9) and work back up.

This frequent deloading approach helps maintain form and allows for multiple "runs" at heavier weights with better technique.

### Program Duration

- **Recommended duration:** 3-6 months for most beginners
- Continue as long as you're making consistent progress with resets
- Move to intermediate programming when resets become very frequent (every 2-3 weeks) across multiple lifts
- Good next steps: 5/3/1, Texas Method, or intermediate Greyskull variants

### Evidence Base

Greyskull LP is recommended for beginners because:

1. **AMRAP Sets:** Allow for autoregulation and additional hypertrophy stimulus beyond strict 5×5 schemes
2. **Balanced Push/Pull:** Equal emphasis on pressing and pulling prevents muscular imbalances
3. **Powerbuilding Focus:** Builds both strength and muscle mass, appealing to aesthetic-focused beginners
4. **Flexible Progression:** AMRAP sets and double-progression option allow for individualized advancement
5. **Lower Volume Per Lift:** 2×5 + 1 AMRAP creates less fatigue than 5×5 while maintaining sufficient stimulus
6. **Sustainable Long-Term:** Frequent small deloads prevent injury and allow for extended progression periods
7. **Proven Results:** Widely successful on Reddit fitness communities and recommended in multiple fitness wikis

### Database Implementation Notes

**Exercises in Database:**
- ✅ Bench Press (exists)

## Ice Cream Fitness 5x5 (ICF 5x5)

### Name
**Ice Cream Fitness 5×5 (ICF 5×5)**

### Author/Source
Created by Jason Blaha as a novice bodybuilding program.

**Links:**
- [Muscle & Strength - ICF 5x5 Official](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout)
- [Ice Cream Fitness Spreadsheet - Lift Vault](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/ice-cream-fitness-icf-spreadsheet/)
- [PowerliftingToWin ICF 5x5 Review](https://www.powerliftingtowin.com/jason-blaha-5x5-novice-routine/)

### Description

Ice Cream Fitness 5×5 is essentially StrongLifts 5×5 with a significant amount of bodybuilding accessory work added. Jason Blaha created this program for beginners who want to build both strength and muscle size (hypertrophy), hence the "Ice Cream" name – you can eat ice cream (metaphorically, gain muscle) while getting strong.

The program's philosophy is that beginners can handle and benefit from more volume than minimalist programs like StrongLifts or Starting Strength provide. By adding accessory exercises targeting arms, abs, and back, ICF 5×5 aims to create a more well-rounded physique while still prioritizing strength gains through the main compound lifts.

ICF 5×5 is ideal for beginner bodybuilders or those with aesthetic goals who still want to build a strength foundation. It's particularly suited for younger lifters or those with good recovery capacity, as the total workout volume is significantly higher than pure strength programs. The program requires approximately 1.5 hours per workout due to the added accessory work.

Blaha makes it very clear this is a novice bodybuilding program, not a powerlifting program. While you will get stronger on the main lifts, the emphasis is on building a balanced, muscular physique through the combination of heavy compound movements and targeted isolation work.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Rest:** At least one full day between workouts
- **Duration per workout:** 1.5 hours (due to accessory volume)
- **Program type:** Full body, alternating workouts (A and B)

### Session Breakdown

#### Workout A
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Squat** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes | Main lift |
| **Bench Press** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes | Main lift |
| **Barbell Row** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes | Main lift |
| **Barbell Shrugs** | 3 × 8 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |
| **Tricep Extensions** | 3 × 8 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |
| **Barbell Curls** | 3 × 8 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |
| **Hyperextensions** | 2 × 10 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |
| **Cable Crunches** | 3 × 10 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |

#### Workout B
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Squat** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes | Main lift |
| **Overhead Press** | 5 × 5 | 3-5 minutes | Main lift |
| **Deadlift** | 1 × 5 | N/A | Main lift |
| **Close Grip Bench Press** | 3 × 8 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |
| **Barbell Curls** | 3 × 8 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |
| **Cable Crunches** | 3 × 10 | 1-2 minutes | Accessory |

**Substitution notes:**
- Hyperextensions can be replaced with Good Mornings or Cable Pull-throughs
- Close Grip Bench Press and Dips are interchangeable
- Cable Crunches can be swapped for other ab exercises
- Additional ab work can be done on off days

### Progression

**Main Lifts (5×5 exercises):**
- Add **5-10 lbs** to lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift) each successful workout
- Add **2-4 lbs** to upper body lifts (Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Row) each successful workout

**Accessory Lifts (3×8 exercises):**
- Progress when you can complete all sets with good form
- Increase weight by smallest increment available (usually 2.5-5 lbs)
- Progression is slower on accessories than main lifts

### Starting Weights

**Main lifts:** Use the same starting weight guidelines as StrongLifts 5×5
- Complete beginners: Start with empty barbell for most lifts
- Returning lifters: Use 50-60% of your estimated 5-rep max

**Accessory lifts:**
- Start with a weight that allows you to complete all prescribed sets and reps with 1-2 reps in reserve
- Should feel moderately challenging but not to failure

### Rest Periods

- **Main lifts (5×5):** 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Accessory lifts (3×8):** 1-2 minutes between sets
- This shorter rest on accessories keeps workout duration reasonable and provides conditioning benefits

### Deload/Stall Protocol

**For main lifts:**
- Use the same deload protocol as StrongLifts 5×5
- If you fail to complete 5×5 for three consecutive workouts, deload by 10%

**For accessory lifts:**
- If stalling on an accessory, maintain the current weight until you can complete all sets
- Accessory progression is less critical than main lift progression

### Program Duration

- **Recommended duration:** 12-16 weeks for beginners
- Continue while making consistent progress on main lifts
- Move to intermediate programming when linear progression stalls repeatedly
- Good next steps: Intermediate bodybuilding splits, upper/lower splits, or programs like nSuns

### Evidence Base

ICF 5×5 is recommended for beginners because:

1. **Strength Foundation:** The 5×5 main lifts build foundational strength like proven programs (StrongLifts, Starting Strength)
2. **Added Hypertrophy:** Accessory work provides additional volume for muscle growth beyond minimalist programs
3. **Balanced Development:** Includes direct arm, ab, and back work that pure strength programs may neglect
4. **Linear Progression:** Novices respond well to adding weight every session
5. **Aesthetic Focus:** Appeals to beginners who care about appearance as much as strength numbers
6. **Established Success:** Popular program with many documented success stories in online fitness communities
7. **Volume Tolerance:** Teaches beginners to handle higher training volumes, preparing them for intermediate programs

**Considerations:**
- Higher time commitment (1.5 hours) may not suit everyone
- More total volume requires adequate nutrition and sleep
- May cause excessive fatigue for older beginners or those with limited recovery capacity

### Database Implementation Notes

**Exercises in Database:**

Main Lifts:
- ✅ Squat (exists)

## Reddit's Basic Beginner Routine

### Name
**r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine**

### Author/Source
Created by the r/Fitness community and maintained in The Fitness Wiki.

**Links:**
- [Official Fitness Wiki Page](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/)
- [Recommended Routines - Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/)

### Description

The r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine is explicitly designed as a "training wheels" program for complete beginners to strength training. Unlike programs designed to be run for extended periods, this routine's primary goal is to get beginners into the gym, teach them the fundamental barbell movements, and build the habit of consistent training.

The program's philosophy is minimalism and simplicity for habit formation. It includes only the essential compound barbell movements needed to build foundational strength, with minimal complexity or decision-making required. This reduces the intimidation factor for true beginners who may feel overwhelmed by more complicated programs.

This routine is ideal for absolute beginners who have never touched a barbell or who need to rebuild the habit of gym attendance. It's intentionally simple and lower in volume than most other beginner programs, making it easier to complete consistently. The program is not designed for long-term progression but rather as a stepping stone to more comprehensive routines.

The routine incorporates the 5/3/1 assistance protocol, requiring lifters to perform additional push, pull, and leg/core work each session. This teaches exercise selection and provides balanced development beyond just the main barbell lifts.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (typically Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Rest:** At least one full day between sessions
- **Duration per workout:** 45-60 minutes
- **Program type:** Full body, alternating workouts (A and B)
- **Set scheme:** 3 sets of 5 reps, with the last set AMRAP (3×5+)

### Session Breakdown

The program alternates between Workout A and Workout B. Each workout includes main barbell lifts plus 5/3/1-style assistance work.

#### Workout A
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Squat** | 3 × 5+ | Last set AMRAP |
| **Bench Press** | 3 × 5+ | Last set AMRAP |
| **Barbell Row** | 3 × 5+ | Last set AMRAP |
| **Push Assistance** | 50-100 reps | Dips, pushups, overhead press, etc. |
| **Pull Assistance** | 50-100 reps | Chin-ups, pull-ups, rows, curls, etc. |
| **Single Leg/Core** | 50-100 reps | Lunges, split squats, leg press, ab work, etc. |

#### Workout B
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Deadlift** | 3 × 5+ | Last set AMRAP |
| **Overhead Press** | 3 × 5+ | Last set AMRAP |
| **Chin-ups** | 3 × 5+ | Last set AMRAP (or lat pulldown) |
| **Push Assistance** | 50-100 reps | Dips, pushups, bench press, etc. |
| **Pull Assistance** | 50-100 reps | Rows, curls, face pulls, etc. |
| **Single Leg/Core** | 50-100 reps | Lunges, leg curls, ab work, etc. |

**Assistance Work Guidelines:**
- Choose one exercise from each category
- Perform 50-100 total reps per category (e.g., 5 sets of 10-20 reps)
- Assistance work should not be taken to failure
- Can superset assistance exercises to save time

### Progression

**Main Lifts:**
- Add **2.5 lbs** to upper body lifts (Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Row, Chin-ups) each workout
- Add **5 lbs** to lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift) each workout

**Accelerated Progression:**
- If you get **more than 10 reps** on your AMRAP set, add **5 lbs** for upper body or **10 lbs** for lower body instead

**Assistance Work:**
- Progress by adding reps, sets, or weight as you feel appropriate
- Not strictly tracked; focus is on getting quality work in

### Starting Weights

- Start conservatively with weights you can handle comfortably for the prescribed reps
- The program is designed to ease you in, so early workouts should feel relatively easy
- Focus on learning proper form and building the gym habit

### Rest Periods

- **Main lifts:** 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Assistance work:** 1-2 minutes, or minimal rest if supersetting
- Rest as needed to maintain performance

### Deload/Stall Protocol

**For main lifts:**
- If you fail to get at least 5 reps on your AMRAP set, deload
- Reduce weight by 10% and build back up
- Focus on form during the deload period

**Note:** Since this program is only recommended for 3 months, you may not need to deload at all if you started conservatively.

### Program Duration

- **Maximum recommended duration:** 3 months
- This is a short-term program designed to teach basics and build habits
- After 3 months, transition to a more comprehensive program

**Recommended next programs:**
- GZCLP
- 5/3/1 for Beginners
- Stronger By Science programs
- Any intermediate program from The Fitness Wiki

The 3-month limit is intentional. While you could continue longer, your progress would be better served by moving to a program with more volume, variety, and periodization.

### Evidence Base

The r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine is recommended for beginners because:

1. **Extreme Simplicity:** Minimal complexity reduces overwhelm for complete beginners
2. **Habit Formation:** Primary goal is building consistency, not maximizing gains
3. **AMRAP Autoregulation:** Last set AMRAP allows for individualized volume
4. **Comprehensive Assistance:** 5/3/1 assistance protocol ensures balanced development
5. **Time-Boxed:** 3-month limit prevents long-term stagnation
6. **Clear Progression Path:** Explicitly directs beginners to better programs after completion
7. **Community Support:** Backed by r/Fitness community with extensive resources
8. **Low Barrier to Entry:** Designed specifically for people new to the gym environment

**Philosophy:**
This program acknowledges that the biggest challenge for beginners isn't finding the optimal program – it's showing up consistently. By keeping things simple and achievable, it helps beginners build the habit that will serve them for years to come.

### Database Implementation Notes

**Exercises in Database:**

Main Lifts:
- ✅ Squat (exists)
- ✅ Bench Press (exists)
- ✅ Barbell Row (exists)
- ✅ Deadlift (exists)
- ✅ Overhead Press (exists)
- ⚠️ Chin-ups (might need to be added; Lat Pulldown exists as alternative)

Assistance work is flexible and lifters choose their own exercises, so most options should be covered in the existing database.

## Phrak's Greyskull LP Variant

### Name
**Phrak's Greyskull LP Variant (Phrak's GSLP)**

### Author/Source
A variant of the original Greyskull LP by John Sheaffer, modified and popularized by Reddit user Phrak and the r/Fitness community.

**Links:**
- [Lift Vault - Greyskull LP](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/greyskull-linear-progression-spreadsheet/)
- [Phrak's GSLP on Boostcamp](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/r-fitness/greyskull-linear-progression)
- [Phrak's GSLP Program - Dr Workout](https://www.drworkout.fitness/phraks-gslp-program/)
- [Outlift - Greyskull LP](https://outlift.com/greyskull-lp/)

### Description

Phrak's Greyskull LP Variant is a streamlined modification of the original Greyskull LP program that has become one of the most popular beginner programs on Reddit. The key difference from the original GSLP is the inclusion of more pulling movements (chin-ups and barbell rows alternated) to balance the pressing work, ensuring better upper body development and postural health.

The program maintains the core Greyskull philosophy of AMRAP sets for autoregulation and increased volume, but simplifies the accessory work compared to the original program. This makes it more accessible for beginners while still providing excellent results for both strength and muscle building.

Phrak's variant is ideal for beginners who want a balanced push/pull program with built-in autoregulation through AMRAP sets. It's particularly well-suited for those concerned about developing imbalances or who want more upper body pulling volume than programs like StrongLifts provide. The program has an excellent reputation on r/Fitness and is frequently recommended in The Fitness Wiki.

The program emphasizes sustainable progression through frequent but small deloads (10% when you miss the minimum reps on an AMRAP set). This approach allows beginners to practice the same movement patterns repeatedly with good form rather than grinding through stalls with poor technique.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3 days per week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Rest:** At least one full day between workouts
- **Duration per workout:** 45-60 minutes
- **Program type:** Full body, alternating workouts (A and B)
- **Set scheme:** 2 sets of 5 reps, then 1 AMRAP set (2×5, 1×5+)

### Session Breakdown

The program alternates between two workouts. Squat and deadlift alternate between sessions, as do overhead press/bench press and chin-ups/barbell rows.

#### Workout A
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Overhead Press** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP on last set |
| **Chin-ups** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 2-3 minutes | See chin-up guidance below |
| **Squat** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP on last set |

#### Workout B
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest Between Sets | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Bench Press** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP on last set |
| **Barbell Row** | 2 × 5, 1 × 5+ | 2-3 minutes | Yates rows or any row variant |
| **Deadlift** | 1 × 5+ | 3-5 minutes | AMRAP set only |

**Alternating pattern:**
- Week 1: A, B, A
- Week 2: B, A, B
- (continues alternating)

**Chin-up Guidance:**
- Chin-ups use a palms-facing-you (supinated) grip, approximately shoulder-width
- Start with bodyweight only
- If you cannot do 3×5 bodyweight chin-ups, perform negatives (jump up, slowly lower down) until you build the strength
- Once you can complete 3×5 bodyweight, start adding weight in 2.5 lb increments

**Optional additions:**
- Power cleans can be used to warm up for deadlifts
- Additional arm or ab work can be added but is not required

### Progression

**Linear Progression:**
- Add **2.5 lbs** to upper body lifts (Overhead Press, Bench Press, Barbell Row, weighted Chin-ups) each workout
- Add **5 lbs** to lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift) each workout

**AMRAP Acceleration:**
- If you hit **10 or more reps** on your AMRAP set, **double** the weight increase next workout
- Example: Get 5, 5, 11 on overhead press at 95 lbs → add 5 lbs instead of 2.5 lbs

This allows for faster progression when you're crushing your AMRAP sets and have plenty of strength in reserve.

### Starting Weights

- Start with weights that allow you to comfortably hit the prescribed reps
- Your first AMRAP set should yield approximately 7-10 reps
- Start conservative to allow room for consistent progression

**Guidelines:**
- Use approximately 65-75% of your estimated 5-rep max
- The first few weeks should feel relatively easy

### Rest Periods

- **Main lifts (Squat, Bench, OHP, Deadlift):** 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Chin-ups and Barbell Rows:** 2-3 minutes between sets
- Rest as needed to maintain performance across sets

### Deload/Stall Protocol

**When to deload:**
- When you fail to get at least 5 reps on your AMRAP set

**How to deload:**
- Reduce weight by **10%** for that specific lift only
- Continue progressing normally on other lifts
- Resume adding weight using normal progression (2.5 lbs or 5 lbs per workout)

**Example:** If you get 5, 5, 4 on bench press at 155 lbs, deload to 140 lbs (155 × 0.9) and work back up.

This frequent deloading approach is a feature, not a bug. It allows you to practice movements with good form and build back up stronger.

### Program Duration

- **Recommended duration:** 3-6 months for most beginners
- Continue as long as you're making progress with periodic resets
- Transition to intermediate programming when resets become very frequent (every 2-3 weeks) across multiple lifts

**Good next programs:**
- Intermediate Greyskull variants
- 5/3/1 for Beginners or other 5/3/1 templates
- GZCL method programs
- Texas Method

### Evidence Base

Phrak's Greyskull LP Variant is recommended for beginners because:

1. **Balanced Push/Pull:** Equal pressing and pulling volume prevents imbalances and promotes better posture
2. **AMRAP Autoregulation:** Allows for individualized volume based on daily performance and recovery
3. **Moderate Volume:** 2×5 + AMRAP provides sufficient stimulus with less fatigue than 5×5 programs
4. **Frequent Deloads:** 10% deloads maintain good form and allow for repeated practice of movement patterns
5. **Flexibility:** AMRAP sets and optional accessories allow for some customization
6. **Proven Track Record:** One of the most successful and frequently recommended programs on r/Fitness
7. **Powerbuilding Focus:** Builds both strength and muscle mass, appealing to most beginner goals
8. **Sustainable:** Lower per-session volume allows for longer progression before burnout

**Advantages over original GSLP:**
- More balanced upper body development through alternating chin-ups and rows
- Simpler accessory work structure (optional rather than prescribed)
- Better suited for general fitness goals vs. the original's military/combat athlete focus

### Database Implementation Notes

**Exercises in Database:**
- ✅ Overhead Press (exists)
- ✅ Bench Press (exists)
- ✅ Squat (exists)
- ✅ Deadlift (exists)
- ✅ Barbell Row (exists)

## GZCLP

### Name
**GZCLP (GZCL Linear Progression)**

### Author/Source
Created by Cody Lefever (u/gzcl on Reddit), a powerlifter and strength coach. GZCLP is the beginner linear progression version of his broader GZCL Method.

- [Say No To Broscience - GZCLP Infographic](https://www.saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/)

### Description

GZCLP is a beginner-friendly linear progression program based on the GZCL Method, a comprehensive approach to strength training developed by competitive powerlifter Cody Lefever. The program is structured around a three-tier system that organizes exercises by priority and intensity: Tier 1 (heavy main lifts), Tier 2 (lighter secondary compounds), and Tier 3 (isolation/accessory work).

The core philosophy of GZCLP is intelligent volume progression through multiple stages. Rather than simply deloading when you fail, GZCLP has you move through progressively lower rep ranges (3s → 2s → 1s for Tier 1) before testing a new max and restarting the cycle. This approach teaches beginners to handle different rep ranges and intensities while maintaining progression.

GZCLP is ideal for beginners who want a more sophisticated program structure than basic linear progressions like StrongLifts, but still want the simplicity of adding weight each workout. It's particularly well-suited for those interested in powerlifting or who want experience with different loading schemes. The program requires 3-4 days per week, making it adaptable to different schedules.

The program's tier system introduces beginners to the concept of exercise prioritization – heavy, low-rep work on primary movements (T1), moderate volume on secondary movements (T2), and higher-rep work on accessories (T3). This structure forms the foundation for intermediate and advanced GZCL programming.

### Structure

- **Frequency:** 3-4 days per week (4 different workouts cycled through)
- **Rest:** At least one full day between sessions (typically Mon/Wed/Fri with optional 4th day)
- **Duration per workout:** 60-75 minutes
- **Program type:** 4 distinct workouts focused on specific main lifts

**Three-Tier System:**
- **Tier 1 (T1):** Primary heavy compound lift - 5×3+ (Stage 1)
- **Tier 2 (T2):** Secondary lighter compound lift - 3×10 (Stage 1)
- **Tier 3 (T3):** Tertiary accessory work - 3×15+

### Session Breakdown

The program consists of 4 distinct workout days, each focused on one of the "Big 4" lifts. Typically run 3 times per week, cycling through the workouts.

| Workout | Tier 1 (5×3+) | Tier 2 (3×10) | Tier 3 (3×15+) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Day 1** | Squat | Bench Press | Lat Pulldown |
| **Day 2** | Overhead Press | Deadlift | Dumbbell Row |
| **Day 3** | Bench Press | Squat | Lat Pulldown |
| **Day 4** | Deadlift | Overhead Press | Dumbbell Row |

**3-day schedule example (most common):**
- Week 1: Day 1 (Mon), Day 2 (Wed), Day 3 (Fri)
- Week 2: Day 4 (Mon), Day 1 (Wed), Day 2 (Fri)
- Week 3: Day 3 (Mon), Day 4 (Wed), Day 1 (Fri)
- (continues cycling)

**4-day schedule example:**
- Mon: Day 1, Tue: Day 2, Thu: Day 3, Fri: Day 4
- (repeat each week)

**Tier 3 Note:** Lat Pulldown and Dumbbell Row can be substituted with other pulling movements (cable rows, barbell rows, chin-ups, etc.). Choose exercises that target back and lats.

### Progression

GZCLP uses a unique stage-based progression system for each tier.

#### Tier 1 Progression (Main Lifts)

**Stage 1:** 5 sets × 3 reps, last set AMRAP (5×3+)
- Add **5 lbs** to Bench Press and Overhead Press after each workout
- Add **10 lbs** to Squat and Deadlift after each workout
- If you fail to complete at least 15 total reps across all sets, move to Stage 2

**Stage 2:** 6 sets × 2 reps, last set AMRAP (6×2+)
- Continue adding weight each session (5 lbs or 10 lbs)
- If you fail to complete at least 12 total reps, move to Stage 3

**Stage 3:** 10 sets × 1 rep, last set AMRAP (10×1+)
- Continue adding weight each session
- If you fail to complete at least 10 total reps, it's time to reset

**Reset Protocol for T1:**
- Test for a new 5-rep max (5RM)
- Use **85% of this new 5RM** to restart at Stage 1
- Resume progression from there

#### Tier 2 Progression (Secondary Lifts)

**Stage 1:** 3 sets × 10 reps (3×10)
- Keep same weight each session; no AMRAP
- When T1 progresses to Stage 2, move T2 to Stage 2

**Stage 2:** 3 sets × 8 reps (3×8)
- When T1 progresses to Stage 3, move T2 to Stage 3

**Stage 3:** 3 sets × 6 reps (3×6)
- When T1 resets, reset T2

**Reset Protocol for T2:**
- Find the last weight you successfully lifted at Stage 1 (3×10)
- Add **15-20 lbs** to this weight
- Restart at Stage 1 with this new weight

#### Tier 3 Progression (Accessories)

**Sets × Reps:** 3 sets × 15 reps, last set AMRAP (3×15+)
- Keep the same weight until you hit **25 reps** on the AMRAP set
- When you hit 25+ reps, add the smallest weight increment available (typically 5 lbs)
- Restart at 3×15+

### Starting Weights

**Tier 1 (5×3+):**
- Use approximately 75-80% of your estimated 5-rep max
- Should be able to get 8-12 reps on your first AMRAP set
- Start conservative to allow room for progression

**Tier 2 (3×10):**
- Use approximately 50-60% of your estimated 1-rep max
- Should be challenging but doable for 3 sets of 10

**Tier 3 (3×15+):**
- Use light weights that allow you to complete 3×15 comfortably
- Should get 18-22 reps on first AMRAP set

### Rest Periods

- **Tier 1 (heavy compounds):** 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Tier 2 (moderate compounds):** 2-3 minutes between sets
- **Tier 3 (accessories):** 1-1.5 minutes between sets

**AMRAP Note:** All AMRAP sets should leave 1-2 reps "in the tank" (RIR). Don't go to absolute muscular failure.

### Deload/Stall Protocol

GZCLP doesn't use traditional deloads. Instead, it uses the stage system:

**Tier 1:**
1. Fail to hit minimum reps → Move to next stage (lower reps, more sets)
2. After Stage 3 fails → Test new 5RM, use 85% to restart at Stage 1

**Tier 2:**
- Follows T1 through the stages
- Resets by adding 15-20 lbs to the last successful Stage 1 weight

**Tier 3:**
- Simply maintains weight until hitting 25 reps on AMRAP set
- No formal deload needed

This system allows you to continue progressing weight while managing fatigue through reduced reps per set.

### Program Duration

- **Recommended duration:** 3-6 months for most beginners
- Continue as long as you're making progress through the stage system
- Move to intermediate programming when resets become very frequent

**Good next programs:**
- GZCL Method (intermediate)
- GZCL Jacked & Tan 2.0
- GZCL UHF (Ultra High Frequency)
- Other intermediate programs like 5/3/1 variants

### Evidence Base

GZCLP is recommended for beginners because:

1. **Structured Progression:** The stage system provides a clear path forward when progress stalls
2. **Multiple Rep Ranges:** Exposes beginners to different intensities (3s, 2s, 1s) and volume (10s, 15s)
3. **Exercise Prioritization:** Three-tier system teaches intelligent program organization
4. **Balanced Development:** Includes heavy compounds, secondary compounds, and accessory work
5. **Autoregulation:** AMRAP sets allow for individualized volume progression
6. **Sustainable:** Stage progression manages fatigue better than constant maximal effort
7. **Proven Method:** Created by accomplished powerlifter with strong theoretical foundation
8. **Flexibility:** 3-day or 4-day scheduling options; T3 exercises are customizable
9. **Long-Term Preparedness:** Introduces GZCL Method concepts that carry into intermediate/advanced training

**Why it's superior to basic linear progressions:**
- More sophisticated fatigue management through stages
- Greater variety in rep ranges and loading
- Built-in periodization even at beginner level
- Teaches program structure principles that apply long-term

### Database Implementation Notes

**Exercises in Database:**

Tier 1 & Tier 2 Main Lifts:
- ✅ Squat (exists)
- ✅ Bench Press (exists)
- ✅ Overhead Press (exists)
- ✅ Deadlift (exists)

Tier 3 Accessories:
- ✅ Lat Pulldown (exists)
- ⚠️ Dumbbell Row (need to verify - "Dumbbell romainain deadlift" exists, need standard dumbbell row)

The program is flexible on T3 exercises, so most pulling variations should be available in the database.
