## Pause Squats

**Equipment:** Barbell, squat rack, optional weightlifting belt and shoes

**Primary Muscles:** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus

**Secondary Muscles:** Hamstrings, Erector Spinae, Core, Adductors

**Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

**Mechanic:** Compound

**Force:** Push

### Instructions
1. Set up barbell on back exactly as you would for regular back squat
2. Unrack and position feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out
3. Descend into squat with normal controlled tempo
4. Upon reaching bottom position (thighs parallel or below), stop all movement
5. Hold motionless pause for 2-3 seconds minimum
6. Relax legs as much as possible while maintaining tight, braced trunk
7. Do NOT let hips sink lower or position shift during pause
8. Eliminate any stretch reflex with the pause duration
9. After pause, drive up explosively with maximum force
10. Maintain straight vertical bar path during ascent
11. Complete rep at full standing position
12. Repeat for programmed repetitions

### Common Mistakes
- Hips sinking lower or shifting during pause
- Not pausing long enough (minimum 2 seconds)
- Maintaining too much leg tension - should relax legs while keeping trunk tight
- Allowing torso position to change during pause
- Bouncing or using momentum to start ascent
- Not achieving adequate depth before pause
- Rushing the pause instead of true motionless hold
- Using too much weight, compromising pause quality

### Variations
- **Front Squat Pause** - Pause front squat variation
- **Pin Squat** - Squat to pins/safety bars, similar concept
- **Double Pause Squat** - Two pauses: one mid-range, one at bottom
- **Long Pause Squat** - Extended 5+ second pause
- **Tempo Squat** - Controlled descent tempo plus pause
- **Safety Bar Pause Squat** - Using specialty squat bar

### Benefits
- Eliminates stretch reflex, building pure concentric strength
- Develops explosiveness out of the hole
- Increases quad and glute strength at weakest position
- Improves positional awareness and control
- Addresses sticking points in regular squat
- Valuable for powerlifters, CrossFitters, and strength athletes

### Programming Notes
- Most lifters can pause squat 85-90% of regular back squat max
- Use mostly lower rep sets, around 1-5 reps per set
- Excellent assistance exercise for competition squat
- 2-3 second pause is standard; longer pauses further reduce weight used

## Trap Bar Deadlifts (Hex Bar Deadlifts)

**Equipment:** Trap bar (hex bar), Olympic plates, optional lifting straps and belt

**Primary Muscles:** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae

**Secondary Muscles:** Trapezius, Forearms, Core, Calves

**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

**Mechanic:** Compound

**Force:** Pull

### Instructions
1. Load trap bar with appropriate weight plates
2. Step inside the center of the trap bar
3. Position feet hip to shoulder-width apart, directly under hips
4. Squat down and grasp handles with neutral grip (palms facing inward)
5. Assume position with hips between high (deadlift) and low (squat)
6. Keep chest up, shoulders back, spine neutral, core braced
7. Take deep breath and engage core maximally
8. Drive through mid-foot and heels, extending hips and knees simultaneously
9. Stand up to full height with hips fully extended
10. Shoulders and hips should rise at same rate - torso angle stays constant
11. Lower weight back down with control, maintaining neutral spine
12. Weight should remain centered around body throughout movement

- [StrengthLog - How to Do Trap Bar Deadlift](https://www.strengthlog.com/trap-bar-deadlift/)

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding the back instead of maintaining neutral spine
- Hips rising first, causing torso to pitch forward
- Not engaging core before initiating lift
- Looking up excessively instead of neutral neck position
- Not driving through full foot - too much on toes or heels
- Incomplete lockout at top (not fully extending hips)
- Dropping weight instead of controlled descent
- Shoulders positioned too far forward instead of over handles
- Not keeping weight centered - bar drifting forward or back

### Variations
- **High Handle Trap Bar Deadlift** - Using elevated handles for reduced range
- **Low Handle Trap Bar Deadlift** - Standard handles, more range of motion
- **Deficit Trap Bar Deadlift** - Standing on platform for increased range
- **Paused Trap Bar Deadlift** - Pause at specific positions during lift
- **Trap Bar Jump** - Explosive variation for power development
- **Single-Leg Trap Bar Deadlift** - Advanced unilateral variation

### Benefits
- Reduced lower back stress compared to conventional deadlift
- More quad-dominant movement pattern
- Easier to maintain neutral spine position
- Better for beginners or those with mobility limitations
- Allows heavier loads due to more favorable biomechanics
- Reduced shear forces on spine
- Great for building overall strength and power
- Neutral grip reduces bicep strain risk
- Weight distribution around center of gravity more natural
