## Kettlebell Exercises

### Turkish Get-Up

**Equipment:** Kettlebell

**Primary Muscles:** Full body (core, shoulders, glutes, quadriceps, triceps)

**Secondary Muscles:** Stabilizing muscles throughout body

**Level:** Intermediate to Expert

**Mechanic:** Compound

**Force:** Push/Static

**Instructions:**

1. **Starting Position:** Lie on your back with right knee bent, right foot flat on ground. Left leg and left arm extended at 45-degree angle. Right arm extended overhead holding kettlebell, knuckles pointing to ceiling. Eyes locked on kettlebell.

2. **Roll to Elbow:** Roll onto left side and prop yourself up on left elbow, using hand and palm to grip the floor.

3. **Press to Hand:** Pull through left hand to lift torso off ground, coming up onto left hand.

4. **Hip Extension:** Drive through right foot to lift hips off ground while sweeping left leg underneath.

5. **Low Lunge:** Position yourself in a low lunge with left knee down.

6. **Stand Up:** Press into right foot to stand, keeping kettlebell overhead.

7. **Reverse:** Reverse the entire sequence to return to starting position.

**Safety Critical Points:**
- Keep eyes on kettlebell throughout entire movement
- Arm should never break the chain - never bend at wrist or elbow
- Control each movement - full Get Up should take at least 30 seconds
- Start with bodyweight ("naked" get-up) before adding load
- Men start with 16kg, women with 8kg for first loaded attempts

**Common Mistakes:**
- Rushing the movement
- Breaking eye contact with kettlebell
- Bending elbow or wrist under load
- Skipping the naked get-up progression
- Poor breathing mechanics

**Variations:**
- Naked Get-Up (bodyweight)
- Bottoms-Up Get-Up (advanced)
- Partial Get-Up to elbow/hand only

**Prerequisites:**
- Ability to perform bodyweight version with perfect form
- Adequate shoulder mobility

### Kettlebell Swing (One-Arm)

**Equipment:** Kettlebell

**Primary Muscles:** Glutes, hamstrings

**Secondary Muscles:** Core, obliques, lats, shoulders, upper back, scapular stabilizers, forearms

**Level:** Intermediate (requires mastery of two-hand swing first)

**Mechanic:** Compound

**Force:** Pull

**Instructions:**

1. **Setup:** Place kettlebell on ground in front of you. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.

2. **Two-Hand Start:** Always start with both hands on kettlebell to square shoulders and prevent bad form.

3. **Hip Hinge:** Push hips back, slight knee bend (not a squat). Maintain neutral spine.

4. **Single Arm Grip:** Transfer to single hand grip, shoulder packed and scapula engaged.

5. **Swing:** Drive hips forward explosively to swing kettlebell. Power comes from hip extension, not arms.

6. **Free Arm:** Mirror the movement of working arm with free arm to keep shoulders square throughout arc of swing.

7. **Control Descent:** Control the descent, maintaining rotational stability through core and obliques.

**Safety Critical Points:**
- Rotational stability is key to one-hand swings
- Keep shoulder packed throughout movement
- Mirror movement with non-working arm
- This is a hip hinge, not a squat
- Start with two hands on bell every rep

**Common Mistakes:**
- Starting with one hand (leads to rotation from beginning)
- Squatting instead of hip hinging
- Allowing shoulders to rotate
- Using arms to lift instead of hip drive
- Inadequate core bracing against rotation

**Variations:**
- Two-Hand Swing (prerequisite)
- Alternating Swings
- Hand-to-Hand Swings

**Prerequisites:**
- Proficiency in two-hand kettlebell swing
- Strong anti-rotation core strength
- Proper hip hinge pattern

**Progressions:**
- Master two-hand swing (100+ reps)
- Practice single-arm with lighter weight
- Build up to Simple & Sinister standard (32kg for men, 24kg for women)

2. **Brace Core:** Exhale sharply, draw abdominals to spine, shoulders back and down, shoulder blades retracted.

3. **Circle Right:** Begin rotating kettlebell to right, bringing it behind head in smooth, controlled movement.

4. **Lower at Neck:** Drop height slightly as kettlebell reaches back of neck.

5. **Complete Circle:** Bring kettlebell back to starting position, completing full circle.

6. **Reverse Direction:** Perform equal reps in opposite direction.

**Safety Critical Points:**
- Keep weight as close to head as possible
- Head and neck stay completely locked with neutral spine
- Don't rush - move slowly and controlled
- Start with light weight (8-12kg)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Moving head/neck around kettlebell instead of kettlebell around head

### Safety Squat Bar (SSB) Squats

**Equipment:** Safety Squat Bar (cambered bar with padded shoulder yokes and handles)

**Primary Muscles:** Quadriceps, glutes

**Secondary Muscles:** Hamstrings, upper back, core, spinal erectors

**Level:** Intermediate

**Instructions:**

1. **Setup:** Position SSB on back, padded yokes resting on traps/shoulders. Grasp handles in front of body.

2. **Stance:** Feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider, toes slightly out.

3. **Brace:** Take deep breath, brace core hard. Bar camber creates forward pull - must resist.

4. **Descent:** Push hips back and down, maintain upright torso (more upright than regular squat). Descend to depth.

5. **Bottom:** Maintain tension, resist forward pull of bar. Upper back works hard here.

6. **Ascent:** Drive through heels, extend hips and knees. Fight to keep torso upright.

7. **Lockout:** Fully extend hips and knees, maintain core brace.

**Safety Critical Points:**
- Bar creates significant forward pull - requires upper back strength
- Easier on shoulders than regular barbell
- Start with lighter weight than regular squat
- Maintain rigid torso throughout
- Can be harder to breathe - practice breathing mechanics

**Common Mistakes:**
- Underestimating difficulty (using too much weight)
- Collapsing forward due to camber
- Insufficient upper back tension
- Poor core bracing
- Incorrect handle position

**Variations:**
- Front-loaded SSB Squat (holds handles only)
- SSB Box Squats
- SSB Good Mornings (advanced)
- SSB Split Squats

**Prerequisites:**
- Solid squat mechanics
- Good core strength
- Upper back strength
- No shoulder issues (though SSB can help work around them)

**Benefits:**
- Reduced shoulder stress/mobility requirements
- Increased quadriceps activation
- Enhanced upper back development
- Novel training stimulus
- Excellent for working around injuries

**Progressions:**
- Start with empty SSB to learn movement
- Begin with 60-70% of regular squat weight
- Build gradually - SSB is deceptively hard
- Use for accessory work or main lift
- Popular in off-season/hypertrophy phases

**Powerlifting Applications:**
- Common accessory for powerlifters
- Builds squat strength with different pattern
- Addresses upper back weakness
- Allows training around shoulder injuries
- Improves regular squat through strengthening weak points

**Mechanic:** Compound

**Force:** Pull

**Instructions:**

1. **Grip:** Grasp pull-up bar with pronated (overhand) grip wider than shoulder-width. Thumbs pointing toward each other.

2. **Dead Hang:** Start from dead hang, arms extended (not locked), shoulders engaged (don't hang passively).

3. **Activation:** Depress shoulder blades, squeeze glutes, brace abs. Take deep breath.

4. **Pull:** Drive elbows straight down toward floor. Pull chest toward bar, leading with elbows.

5. **Top Position:** Continue until collarbone reaches bar or chin clears bar. Squeeze upper back and lats hard.

6. **Descent:** Lower with control to almost full extension. Maintain shoulder engagement.

**Safety Critical Points:**
- Avoid completely locking out at bottom (protects elbow/shoulder ligaments)
- Don't swing or use momentum
- Keep shoulders depressed (down, not shrugged)
- Wider grip = more shoulder stress, ensure adequate mobility
- Build up volume gradually

**Common Mistakes:**
- Swinging or kipping when strict pull-ups intended
