## 1. Face Pulls

### Equipment
- Cable machine with rope attachment (primary)
- Resistance band (alternative)

### Primary Muscles
- Posterior deltoids (rear delts)
- Rhomboids
- Middle trapezius

### Secondary Muscles
- Rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus, teres minor)
- Lower trapezius
- Teres major

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
10-20 reps (hypertrophy focus on slow-twitch stabilizer muscles)

### Instructions
1. Position cable pulley at top position, just above head height
2. Attach rope accessory and grasp each end with overhand or underhand grip (personal preference)
3. Take several steps back until weight comes off stack, arms extended in front
4. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, lean back slightly, engage core
5. Pull rope handles toward your forehead/face while keeping elbows high
6. Externally rotate shoulders as you pull, separating the rope ends
7. Feel shoulder blades retract and pinch together at peak contraction
8. Hold briefly (1-2 seconds), then return to start with control

### Common Mistakes
- **Using too much weight**: Causes momentum-based movement instead of controlled muscle contraction
- **Pulling too low**: Reduces rear delt activation when pulling below shoulder height
- **Elbows dropping**: Keep elbows at or above shoulder level throughout movement
- **Not externally rotating**: Missing the rotator cuff activation by failing to pull rope apart
- **Excessive body lean**: Using body English instead of isolating the target muscles

### Variations
- **High face pulls**: Standard variation, rope at upper cable position
- **Mid-level face pulls**: Rope at shoulder height for different angle
- **Band face pulls**: Using resistance bands for home training or warm-ups
- **Single-arm face pulls**: Unilateral work for addressing imbalances
- **Prone face pulls**: Lying face down on incline bench with bands for different stimulus

## 2. Tricep Pushdowns

### Equipment
- Cable machine
- Various attachments: straight bar, EZ bar, rope, V-bar

### Primary Muscles
- Triceps brachii (all three heads: lateral, medial, long)
- Emphasis on lateral and medial heads

### Secondary Muscles
- Anconeus
- Forearm extensors (grip)

### Level
Beginner

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Push

### Optimal Rep Range
12-20 reps (pump and mind-muscle connection)

### Instructions
1. Position cable attachment at upper position on cable machine
2. Grasp attachment with overhand grip (pronated), hands at comfortable width
3. Stand with feet hip-width apart or staggered stance for stability
4. Tuck elbows at your sides, positioned directly in front of hips
5. Keep elbows stationary, engage core, maintain neutral spine
6. Push attachment down explosively until arms are fully extended
7. Pause briefly at bottom, maximally contracting triceps
8. Return to starting position slowly and controlled (2-3 second eccentric)
9. Stop when forearms are parallel to ground or slightly above

### Common Mistakes
- **Elbow flaring**: Allowing elbows to drift away from torso reduces tricep isolation
- **Using momentum**: Leaning forward or rocking body to move weight
- **Incomplete extension**: Not achieving full lockout at bottom of movement
- **Too much weight**: Sacrificing form and range of motion for heavier load
- **Fast eccentric**: Rushing the return phase instead of controlling the negative

### Variations
- **Rope pushdown**: Allows greater ROM with pronation at bottom; superior tricep engagement per research
- **Straight bar pushdown**: Allows slightly more weight; overhand grip; good for overall mass
- **V-bar pushdown**: Neutral grip variation, wrist-friendly
- **Single-arm pushdown**: Unilateral work for addressing strength imbalances
- **Reverse grip pushdown**: Underhand grip emphasizes medial head
- **Overhead cable extension**: Changes angle to emphasize long head

## 3. Leg Extension

### Equipment
- Leg extension machine

### Primary Muscles
- Quadriceps (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, rectus femoris)

### Secondary Muscles
- None (pure isolation exercise)

### Level
Beginner

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Push

### Optimal Rep Range
12-15 reps for hypertrophy; 15-20 for conditioning

### Instructions
1. Adjust machine seat so knees align with machine's pivot point
2. Set pad position to rest on top of shins just above ankles
3. Position knees at 90-degree angle when seated
4. Grip handles at sides of seat for stability
5. Engage core and extend both legs simultaneously
6. Lift pad until legs are completely straight (full extension)
7. Hold peak contraction for 1 second, squeeze quadriceps hard
8. Lower weight back to starting position in controlled manner
9. Maintain constant tension; don't let weight stack touch between reps

### Common Mistakes
- **Lifting hips off seat**: Using momentum instead of quad strength
- **Incomplete extension**: Not achieving full lockout reduces quad activation
- **Too much weight**: Compromising form and using momentum
- **Jerky movements**: Bouncing the weight instead of smooth controlled reps
- **Hyperextension**: Locking knees aggressively can stress knee joint

### Variations
- **Single-leg extension**: Unilateral work for addressing imbalances
- **Toes pointed out**: Emphasizes vastus medialis (inner quad)
- **Toes pointed in**: Emphasizes vastus lateralis (outer quad)
- **1.5 reps**: Full extension, half down, back up, then full negative
- **Slow eccentrics**: 4-5 second lowering phase for enhanced muscle damage

## 4. Leg Press

### Equipment
- Leg press machine (45-degree, horizontal, or vertical variations)

### Primary Muscles
- Quadriceps (all four heads)
- Gluteus maximus
- Hamstrings

### Secondary Muscles
- Adductors (inner thigh)
- Calves (gastrocnemius, soleus)
- Core stabilizers

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Compound (multiple joints, but machine-stabilized)

### Force
Push

### Optimal Rep Range
8-15 reps for strength-hypertrophy; 15-20 for conditioning

### Instructions
1. Adjust seat so knees are at 90-degree angle when feet are on platform
2. Place feet on platform at desired width and height
3. Keep back and head pressed firmly against pad throughout movement
4. Release safety handles and lower platform with control
5. Lower until knees reach approximately 90 degrees (or slightly below)
6. Push platform away by extending legs, driving through heels
7. Extend legs fully without locking knees hard
8. Maintain constant core tension and avoid rounding lower back

### Common Mistakes
- **Knees caving inward**: Valgus collapse reduces power and risks injury
- **Lower back rounding**: Allowing pelvis to tilt when going too deep
- **Locking knees hard**: Hyperextension transfers stress to knee joints
- **Partial reps**: Not achieving adequate depth for full quad engagement
- **Bouncing at bottom**: Using momentum instead of muscular control

### Variations

**Foot Placement Variations:**
- **High foot placement**: Emphasizes glutes and hamstrings, reduces quad involvement
- **Low foot placement**: Maximizes quadriceps activation with deeper knee flexion
- **Wide stance**: Targets inner thighs (adductors), glutes, and hamstrings
- **Narrow stance**: Emphasizes outer quads (vastus lateralis)
- **Toes on edge**: Calf-focused variation with heels elevated

**Machine Types:**
- **45-degree leg press**: Most common; balanced muscle activation
- **Horizontal leg press**: Beginner-friendly, less spinal loading
- **Vertical leg press**: Advanced; maximal quad focus

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
10-15 reps for hypertrophy; 12-20 for pump work

### Instructions
1. Attach desired handle to low cable pulley position
2. Stand facing cable machine, grasp handle with underhand grip
3. Position feet shoulder-width apart, slight bend in knees
4. Keep elbows tucked at sides, positioned just in front of hips
5. Engage core, maintain neutral spine throughout movement
6. Curl bar toward chest by bending elbows, keeping upper arms stationary
7. Squeeze biceps hard at peak contraction (bar near upper chest)
8. Lower weight with control, resisting the negative for 2-3 seconds
9. Maintain constant tension; don't let weight stack rest between reps

### Common Mistakes
- **Swinging body**: Using momentum instead of strict bicep contraction
- **Elbows moving forward**: Reduces bicep isolation when shoulders flex

### Primary Muscles
- Brachialis (primary mover for elbow flexion)
- Brachioradialis (forearm muscle)
- Biceps brachii (secondary)

### Secondary Muscles
- Forearm flexors
- Wrist stabilizers

### Level
Beginner

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
10-15 reps for hypertrophy; can go heavier (6-10) due to stronger neutral grip position

### Instructions
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart holding dumbbells at sides
2. Grip dumbbells with neutral grip (palms facing inward/toward body)
3. Keep elbows locked close to sides throughout entire movement
4. Maintain straight posture with chest up and shoulders back
5. Curl dumbbells up toward shoulders, keeping neutral grip
6. Lift until forearms are roughly parallel to floor
7. Squeeze brachialis and forearms at top, hold for 1-2 seconds
8. Lower dumbbells with control back to starting position
9. Actively grip dumbbells tight to enhance brachialis activation

### Common Mistakes
- **Rotating wrists**: Turning palms up reduces brachialis emphasis
- **Elbow drift**: Allowing elbows to move forward or away from torso
- **Using momentum**: Swinging weights instead of controlled curling
- **Incomplete ROM**: Not lowering to full extension or curling to full contraction
- **Too fast tempo**: Rushing reps instead of focusing on muscle tension

### Variations
- **Alternating hammer curls**: One arm at a time for focus and control
- **Cross-body hammer curls**: Curling across body toward opposite shoulder
- **Seated hammer curls**: Removes momentum, stricter form
- **Incline hammer curls**: Performed on incline bench for stretch
- **Rope cable hammer curls**: Cable variation with constant tension
- **Preacher hammer curls**: Performed on preacher bench for isolation

### Research Note

## 7. Hyperextensions

### Equipment
- Hyperextension bench (45-degree GHD or Roman chair)
- Bodyweight or weighted (holding plate, dumbbell, or barbell)

### Primary Muscles
- Erector spinae (lower back)
- Gluteus maximus
- Hamstrings

### Secondary Muscles
- Multifidus
- Quadratus lumborum
- Core stabilizers

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation (posterior chain focus)

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
12-20 reps bodyweight; 8-12 with added resistance

### Instructions
1. Position yourself in hyperextension machine with feet anchored
2. Adjust pad so hips rest on pad, torso roughly perpendicular to legs at 45-degree angle
3. Cross arms over chest or behind head
4. Begin in hinged position with torso angled downward
5. Initiate movement by flexing glutes and engaging hamstrings
6. Extend hips to raise torso until body forms straight line
7. Upper body should reach parallel to ground or slightly above
8. Avoid overextending lower back past neutral spine
9. Lower with control back to starting position

### Common Mistakes
- **Hyperextending spine**: Going too high causes excessive lumbar extension
- **Feeling it in lower back only**: Should feel glutes/hamstrings; excessive lower back means poor form
- **Using momentum**: Bouncing instead of controlled muscular contraction
- **Rounding spine**: Losing neutral spine position
- **Neck hyperextension**: Looking up excessively instead of maintaining neutral neck

### Variations
- **Glute-emphasis hyperextensions**: Toes pointed out, chin tucked, focus on hip extension
- **Hamstring-emphasis**: Toes neutral or slightly in
- **Weighted hyperextensions**: Holding plate across chest for progressive overload
- **Single-leg hyperextensions**: Unilateral work
- **Rounded-back hyperextensions**: For spinal erector isolation (advanced)

### Targeting Tips
**For Glute Emphasis:**
- Point toes outward (external hip rotation)
- Keep chin tucked to limit lumbar involvement
- Focus on hip extension rather than back extension

**For Hamstring Emphasis:**
- Keep toes neutral or slightly inward
- Focus on feeling stretch in hamstrings

## 8. Dumbbell Flyes

### Equipment
- Dumbbells
- Flat bench, incline bench, or decline bench

### Primary Muscles
- Pectoralis major (sternal and clavicular heads)
- Focus on stretch and adduction

### Secondary Muscles
- Anterior deltoids (minimal)
- Serratus anterior

### Level
Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Push (horizontal adduction)

### Optimal Rep Range
10-15 reps for hypertrophy; lighter weight for muscle control and stretch

### Instructions
1. Lie back on flat bench with dumbbell in each hand
2. Drive shoulder blades back into bench to set stable shoulder position
3. Press dumbbells to starting position above chest, arms extended
4. Keep feet flat on ground, squeeze glutes and abs for full-body tension
5. Maintain slight bend in elbows (forearms perpendicular to ground)
6. Lower weights out to sides in wide arc, moving only at shoulders
7. Lower to comfortable point where you feel deep stretch on chest
8. Think about squeezing tennis ball between shoulder blades throughout
9. Bring weights back together using chest adduction (not pressing)
10. Stop weights just before they touch at top, maintaining tension

### Common Mistakes
- **Bending elbows excessively**: Turns exercise into a press movement
- **Going too heavy**: Compromises form and risks shoulder injury
- **Touching weights together**: Releases tension at top of movement
- **Shoulder blades not retracted**: Reduces pec stretch and increases shoulder stress
- **Going too deep**: Excessive stretch can strain shoulder joint
- **Fast tempo**: Rushing through reps instead of controlled stretch and squeeze

### Variations
- **Flat bench dumbbell flyes**: Standard variation for mid-chest
- **Incline dumbbell flyes**: 30-45 degree angle targets upper chest (clavicular head)
- **Decline dumbbell flyes**: Emphasizes lower chest (sternal head)
- **Single-arm flyes**: Unilateral work for greater stretch and focus
- **Cable flyes**: Maintains constant tension (unlike dumbbells which lose tension at top)
- **Floor flyes**: Limited ROM variation, shoulder-friendly

### Key Principle
The magic of flyes occurs at the top during peak contraction (adduction), not at the bottom. Focus on the squeeze and bringing arms together using chest muscles.

## 9. Upright Rows

### Equipment
- Barbell, EZ bar, dumbbells, or cable machine
- Various grip widths

### Primary Muscles
- Lateral deltoids (middle delts)
- Upper trapezius

### Secondary Muscles
- Anterior deltoids
- Rhomboids
- Biceps brachii
- Forearms

### Level
Intermediate

### Mechanic
Compound (but shoulder-dominant)

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
10-15 reps with light to moderate weight (not a heavy exercise)

### Instructions
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Grip barbell with hands slightly narrower than shoulder-width (overhand grip)
3. Let barbell hang at arm's length in front of thighs
4. Keep bar close to torso throughout movement
5. Pull barbell upward toward chin, leading with elbows
6. Lift elbows out to sides and up
7. **Stop when elbows are level with shoulders** (not higher)
8. Pause briefly at top, feeling delt and trap contraction
9. Lower barbell with control back to starting position

### Common Mistakes
- **Lifting elbows too high**: Going above shoulder height causes shoulder impingement
- **Using too much weight**: Dramatically increases injury risk
- **Internal rotation**: Shoulders rotate internally when elbows go too high
- **Grip too narrow**: Increases shoulder stress
- **Jerking motion**: Using momentum instead of controlled movement
- **Wrists above elbows**: Poor mechanics; keep elbows highest point

### Variations
- **Dumbbell upright rows**: Safer due to more natural movement pattern
- **Wide-grip upright rows**: Reduces shoulder impingement risk
- **Cable upright rows**: Constant tension variation
- **Single-arm cable upright rows**: Unilateral work
- **High pulls**: More explosive Olympic lifting variation

### Safety Note
Upright rows involve shoulder internal rotation with elevation, which can cause impingement issues. Dumbbells are safer than barbells due to independent arm movement. Always use light to moderate weight and stop below shoulder height.

### Level
Intermediate to Advanced

### Mechanic
Compound

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
3-8 reps for strength; 8-12 for hypertrophy (can use heavier loads than deadlifts)

### Instructions
1. Set safety pins in power rack at knee height (or just below/above)
2. Load barbell on pins and position yourself with barbell against body
3. Stand with feet hip to shoulder-width apart
4. Grip barbell just outside thighs with overhand or mixed grip
5. Position shoulders slightly in front of bar or directly in line
6. Before pulling, squeeze hands hard and tighten lat muscles
7. Brace core and maintain neutral spine
8. Initiate pull by driving hips forcefully toward bar
9. Pull bar up along body to full lockout (hip and knee extension)
10. Squeeze traps and upper back hard at top
11. Lower with control back to pins

### Common Mistakes
- **Rounding upper back**: Losing thoracic extension reduces trap engagement
- **Jerking the weight**: Using momentum instead of controlled pull
- **Not locking out**: Incomplete hip extension reduces effectiveness
- **Bar drifting away**: Should stay close to body throughout pull
- **Weak grip**: Failing to actively squeeze bar reduces upper back activation

### Variations
- **Below-knee rack pulls**: Closer to full deadlift, more leg involvement
- **Above-knee rack pulls**: Maximum trap and upper back emphasis
- **Chain-resisted rack pulls**: Accommodating resistance
- **Deficit rack pulls**: Standing on plates for greater ROM
- **Snatch-grip rack pulls**: Wide grip for increased upper back work

### Benefits for Powerlifting

- Posterior deltoids

### Secondary Muscles
- Erector spinae
- Core stabilizers
- Glutes and hamstrings (isometric)
- Forearms and grip
- Biceps

### Level
Intermediate to Advanced

### Mechanic
Compound

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
5-8 reps for strength and power; 8-12 for hypertrophy

### Instructions
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, barbell on floor in front of you
2. Bend at hips with back flat and parallel to floor
3. Maintain micro-bend in knees, hips pushed back
4. Grip barbell with overhand grip, hands just wider than shoulder-width
5. Keep core activated and back braced in rigid position
6. Pull barbell explosively from floor toward lower chest
7. Drive elbows behind you as you lift, hinging at elbows
8. Touch bar to chest/upper abdomen at top
9. Lower barbell all the way back to floor with control
10. Reset completely between each rep (dead stop)

### Common Mistakes
- **Raising torso**: Back should stay parallel to floor throughout
- **Using legs**: Should be pure upper body pull with minimal leg drive
- **Not touching floor**: Defeats purpose of dead-stop reset
- **Slow tempo**: Should be explosive concentric
- **Rounding back**: Losing neutral spine position
- **Pulling to wrong position**: Should pull to lower chest/upper abdomen, not neck

### Variations
- **Standard Pendlay row**: Dead stop from floor each rep
- **Deficit Pendlay rows**: Standing on plates for greater ROM
- **Underhand Pendlay rows**: Supinated grip for different muscle emphasis
- **Paused Pendlay rows**: Hold at top for 2-3 seconds

### Key Differences from Barbell Rows
- **Dead stop between reps** vs. weight staying suspended
- **Explosive pull** vs. controlled tempo
- **Torso parallel to floor** vs. more upright position
- **Greater power development** for Olympic lifts

### Benefits
- Builds explosive pulling strength
- Translates to better cleans, snatches, and deadlifts
- Forces strict form (can't use momentum between reps)
- Develops upper back thickness
- Improves grip strength

- Teres major and minor

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
12-20 reps with light to moderate weight

### Instructions

**Dumbbell Variation (Bent-Over):**
1. Hinge from hips until torso is almost parallel to floor
2. Hold dumbbells with arms hanging straight down from shoulders
3. Use neutral grip (palms facing each other)
4. Keep slight bend in elbows throughout movement
5. Maintain flat back and engaged core
6. Pull dumbbells laterally out to sides and upward
7. Lead with elbows, focusing on rear delts
8. Lift until arms are roughly parallel to floor
9. Squeeze rear delts and upper back at top
10. Lower with control back to starting position

**Cable Variation (Standing):**
1. Set both cable pulleys at chest height
2. Attach single handles to each cable
3. Reach across body and grab left handle with right hand, vice versa
4. Step back with arms extended in front, crossed over
5. Pull handles laterally out to sides in wide arc
6. Keep elbows slightly bent and fixed
7. Focus on shoulder joint movement, not scapular retraction
8. Squeeze rear delts at peak contraction

### Common Mistakes
- **Using too much weight**: Causes momentum and poor form
- **Excessive scapular retraction**: Should move at shoulder joint, limited shoulder blade movement
- **Bending elbows too much**: Reduces rear delt emphasis
- **Fast tempo**: Rushing instead of controlled movement
- **Lifting torso on dumbbell version**: Should maintain hinged position

### Variations
- **Bent-over dumbbell reverse flyes**: Standard variation
- **Seated bent-over reverse flyes**: More stable, removes lower back involvement
- **Incline bench reverse flyes**: Chest-supported for strict isolation
- **Standing cable reverse flyes**: Constant tension
- **Pec deck reverse flyes**: Machine-based, easy to learn
- **Single-arm cable reverse flyes**: Unilateral work

### Cable vs. Dumbbell
Cables provide constant tension throughout entire ROM, while dumbbells lose resistance at certain points due to gravity. Cables maintain consistent muscle fiber recruitment throughout movement.

4. Position elbow just below knee for stable anchor point
5. Extend arm fully at bottom, palm facing away from body
6. Curl dumbbell up toward shoulder in strict arc
7. Focus intensely on bicep contraction (mind-muscle connection)
8. Squeeze hard at top for 1-2 seconds
9. Lower dumbbell slowly and controlled to full extension
10. Complete all reps on one side before switching

### Common Mistakes
- **Using momentum**: Swinging weight instead of strict curl
- **Not going full ROM**: Failing to achieve complete extension or full contraction
- **Elbow sliding**: Allowing elbow to move during curl
- **Going too heavy**: Sacrificing form and peak contraction for weight
- **Rushing reps**: Fast tempo instead of controlled squeeze
- **Twisting torso**: Using body English to assist curl

### Variations
- **Seated concentration curls**: Standard variation as described
- **Standing concentration curls**: Bent over, bracing arm on leg
- **Incline concentration curls**: Seated on incline bench
- **Cable concentration curls**: Using low cable pulley
- **Preacher concentration curls**: Combining preacher bench with unilateral focus

### Mind-Muscle Connection
Concentration curls are specifically designed for maximum mind-muscle connection. Research shows this exercise activates biceps more effectively when performed with focus on the muscle contraction rather than just moving weight.

### Key Benefits
- Eliminates momentum and cheating
- Forces strict form
- Develops bicep peak (especially when using full supination)
- Addresses bilateral strength imbalances
- Excellent for finishing movement in arm workouts

### Links
- EMG studies show high biceps activation with concentration curls
- Named for the mental "concentration" required on the contraction
- Popularized by Arnold Schwarzenegger in bodybuilding

## 14. Lying Tricep Extensions (Skullcrushers)

### Equipment
- EZ curl bar (preferred)
- Straight barbell (alternative)
- Dumbbells (alternative)
- Flat bench

### Primary Muscles
- Triceps brachii (all three heads, especially long head)

### Secondary Muscles
- Anconeus
- Forearm stabilizers

### Level
Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Push

### Optimal Rep Range
8-12 reps for hypertrophy; 10-15 for safety and joint health

### Instructions
1. Lie flat on bench with feet firmly planted on floor
2. Hold EZ bar with close grip (hands 6-8 inches apart)
3. Press bar to starting position with arms extended above chest
4. **Angle arms slightly back toward head** (not perpendicular to body)
5. Keep upper arms stationary and angled throughout movement
6. Lower bar by bending only at elbows (shoulder angle stays fixed)
7. Lower bar toward forehead or just behind top of head
8. Stop when bar is about 1 inch from forehead
9. Pause briefly at bottom stretch
10. Extend arms back to starting position by contracting triceps
11. Maintain constant tension (don't lock out completely)

### Common Mistakes
- **Flaring elbows out**: Reduces tricep tension and stresses elbows
- **Arms perpendicular to body**: Loses tension at top; angle slightly back instead
- **Lowering to wrong position**: Bar should go to/past forehead, not to chest
- **Using too much weight**: Primary cause of elbow pain
- **Moving upper arms**: Should remain stationary; movement only at elbow
- **No warm-up**: Cold elbows are prone to injury with this exercise

### Variations
- **EZ bar skullcrushers**: Standard variation, wrist-friendly
- **Dumbbell skullcrushers**: Independent arm movement
- **Decline skullcrushers**: Increased stretch on triceps
- **Incline skullcrushers**: Different angle of resistance
- **To-nose variation**: Lowering to nose instead of forehead
- **Overhead variation**: Lowering behind head for greater long head stretch

### Elbow Safety
- Warm up thoroughly before performing
- Start with light weight to perfect form
- Avoid overextension at top
- If experiencing elbow pain, try incline/decline angle or adjust elbow position
- Consider wrist wraps if wrist discomfort occurs
- Use moderate weight and focus on contraction, not max weight

### EZ Bar Benefits
EZ bar is preferred because the curved grip places less stress on wrists compared to straight barbell while maintaining full tricep activation.

## 15. Stiff-Leg Deadlifts

### Equipment
- Barbell and plates
- Dumbbells (alternative)

### Primary Muscles
- Hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus)
- Gluteus maximus
- Erector spinae

### Secondary Muscles
- Adductor magnus
- Forearms and grip
- Upper back (isometric)

### Level
Intermediate

### Mechanic
Compound

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
8-12 reps for hypertrophy; 12-15 for hamstring development

### Instructions
1. Stand holding barbell with overhand grip at hip level
2. Position feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward
3. Keep legs nearly straight with very slight knee bend (soft knee)
4. Maintain neutral spine and engaged core
5. Hinge at hips, pushing glutes back as you lower bar
6. Lower barbell down along front of legs
7. Keep bar close to body throughout movement
8. Lower until you feel deep stretch in hamstrings (typically mid-shin or below)
9. Keep back flat; do not round spine
10. Drive hips forward to return to standing position
11. Squeeze glutes at top of movement

### Common Mistakes
- **Rounding lower back**: Losing neutral spine is dangerous
- **Bending knees too much**: Turns into Romanian deadlift
- **Locking knees completely**: Hyperextension stresses knee joints
- **Bar drifting away**: Should travel close to legs
- **Looking up**: Hyperextending neck; keep neutral
- **Going too low**: Beyond flexibility range risks back rounding

### Variations
- **Barbell stiff-leg deadlifts**: Standard variation
- **Dumbbell stiff-leg deadlifts**: Easier to position, more natural ROM
- **Deficit stiff-leg deadlifts**: Standing on plates for greater stretch
- **Single-leg stiff-leg deadlifts**: Unilateral hamstring work
- **Snatch-grip stiff-leg deadlifts**: Wide grip increases ROM and upper back work

### Stiff-Leg vs. Romanian Deadlifts

**Stiff-Leg Deadlifts:**
- Legs kept straighter (minimal knee bend)
- Bar can lower all the way to floor or below
- Greater hamstring stretch
- More emphasis on hamstring flexibility

**Romanian Deadlifts:**
- Slight knee bend maintained throughout
- Bar typically lowers to mid-shin (just below knees)
- Starts from standing (top-down)
- More focus on eccentric control

Both are excellent hamstring developers; choose based on flexibility and program goals.

### Key Benefits
- Maximal hamstring stretch and development
- Develops hip hinge pattern
- Improves posterior chain strength
- Enhances hamstring flexibility when done with control
- Complements quad-dominant exercises

### Links
- Proper hip hinge mechanics are essential
- Often confused with Romanian deadlifts
- Popular in bodybuilding for hamstring development

## 16. Preacher Curls

### Equipment
- Preacher bench (Scott bench)
- EZ curl bar (preferred)
- Straight barbell
- Dumbbells
- Cable machine (alternative)

### Primary Muscles
- Biceps brachii (especially long head for peak development)
- Peak contraction emphasis

### Secondary Muscles
- Brachialis
- Brachioradialis
- Forearm flexors

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
8-12 reps for hypertrophy; 10-15 for bicep peak development

### Instructions
1. Adjust preacher bench so pad rests just under armpits when seated
2. Sit with chest against pad, feet flat on floor
3. Grasp bar with underhand grip at shoulder-width
4. Extend arms fully with upper arms flat against pad
5. Ensure upper arms remain completely stationary on pad
6. Curl bar upward, contracting biceps
7. Lift until bar reaches shoulder height
8. Stop before weight is perpendicular (maintain tension)
9. Squeeze biceps hard at top for 1-2 seconds
10. Lower slowly below 90-degree joint angle for full stretch
11. Maintain constant tension; don't rest at bottom

### Common Mistakes
- **Lifting shoulders/upper arms**: Should stay planted on pad
- **Not using full ROM**: Failing to achieve full stretch at bottom
- **Using too much weight**: Compromises form and stresses bicep tendons
- **Swinging motion**: Using momentum instead of strict curl
- **Incomplete contraction**: Not curling high enough
- **Elbows sliding off pad**: Reduces stability and isolation

### Variations
- **EZ bar preacher curls**: Most popular; wrist-friendly angle
- **Dumbbell preacher curls**: Unilateral work, can add supination twist
- **Straight bar preacher curls**: Maximum bicep activation with full supination
- **Cable preacher curls**: Constant tension variation
- **Machine preacher curls**: Different strength curve, consistent resistance
- **Reverse preacher curls**: Overhand grip targets brachioradialis
- **Wide-grip preacher curls**: Emphasizes inner/short head
- **Close-grip preacher curls**: Emphasizes outer/long head

### Peak Development
The long head of the biceps creates the peaked appearance when flexed. The preacher curl angle keeps continuous tension on this muscle throughout entire ROM, making it one of the best exercises for developing bicep peaks.

### Equipment Comparisons
- **EZ Bar**: Reduces wrist strain while activating brachialis; most versatile
- **Dumbbells**: Best for individual arm work and addressing imbalances
- **Machine**: Easiest to learn; good for emphasizing squeeze without losing tension

Research shows comparable hypertrophy between barbell and machine versions when programmed properly.

## 17. Spider Curls

### Equipment
- Incline bench or preacher bench
- EZ curl bar (preferred)
- Dumbbells
- Barbell

### Primary Muscles
- Biceps brachii (especially short head)
- Emphasizes shortened/contracted position

### Secondary Muscles
- Brachialis
- Brachioradialis
- Forearm flexors

### Level
Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
10-15 reps for hypertrophy and peak contraction

### Instructions
1. Set incline bench to approximately 45-60 degrees
2. Lie face down (prone) with chest against incline pad
3. Let arms hang straight down toward floor on front side of bench
4. Grasp bar with underhand grip at shoulder-width
5. Keep upper arms perpendicular to floor, fully extended at start
6. Curl bar up by bending elbows only
7. Lift until biceps are fully contracted (bar near shoulders)
8. Upper arms should remain stationary and vertical
9. Squeeze biceps maximally at top for 1-2 seconds
10. Lower bar slowly and controlled to full arm extension
11. Do not let elbows drift back or shoulders move

### Common Mistakes
- **Allowing elbows to drift backward**: Reduces tension on biceps
- **Using momentum**: Swinging weight instead of strict curl
- **Partial ROM**: Not achieving full extension or full contraction
- **Shoulders moving**: Should isolate elbow flexion only
- **Going too heavy**: Form breaks down with excessive weight
- **Fast tempo**: Rushing instead of controlled contraction

### Variations
- **EZ bar spider curls**: Standard variation with wrist-friendly grip
- **Dumbbell spider curls**: Independent arm movement
- **Barbell spider curls**: Straight bar for maximum bicep activation
- **Cable spider curls**: Constant tension variation
- **Reverse spider curls**: Overhand grip for brachioradialis
- **Preacher bench spider curls**: Using opposite side of preacher bench

### Key Characteristics
Spider curls emphasize the **shortened position** of the biceps at peak contraction, opposite to exercises like incline curls which emphasize the stretched position. This makes them excellent for:
- Developing bicep peak
- Improving muscle control
- Reducing momentum and cheating
- Focusing on the squeeze and contraction phase

### Spider Curls vs. Preacher Curls
- **Spider curls**: Arms vertical, removes shoulder involvement entirely
- **Preacher curls**: Arms angled on pad, some anterior delt involvement
- **Spider curls**: More strict isolation, less weight used
- **Preacher curls**: Can handle more weight due to mechanical advantage

### Benefits
- Eliminates momentum completely
- Pure bicep isolation
- Excellent mind-muscle connection
- Prevents elbow drift backward
- Good for finishing exercise in bicep workouts
- Complements exercises that focus on stretched position

### Links
- Featured in many classic bodybuilding routines
- Named for the "spider" prone position on bench
- Popularized by bodybuilders for bicep peak development

## 18. Incline Dumbbell Curls

### Equipment
- Incline bench (adjustable)
- Dumbbells

### Primary Muscles
- Biceps brachii (especially long head)
- Emphasizes stretched position

### Secondary Muscles
- Brachialis
- Brachioradialis
- Anterior deltoids (stabilizers)

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Pull

### Optimal Rep Range
8-12 reps for hypertrophy; 10-15 for stretch-mediated growth

### Instructions
1. Set incline bench to 45-60 degrees (60 degrees recommended)
2. Sit back on bench with back and head fully supported
3. Plant feet firmly on floor for stability
4. Hold dumbbells with arms hanging naturally downward
5. Start with neutral or slightly supinated grip
6. Maintain good posture with chest up and shoulders back
7. Keep elbows pointed down and slightly behind body
8. Curl dumbbells up by bending elbows only
9. Can supinate wrists (turn palms up) as you curl
10. Keep elbows in same position (don't drift forward)
11. Squeeze biceps at top, then lower slowly with control
12. Lower to full arm extension to maximize stretch

### Common Mistakes
- **Elbows drifting forward**: Reduces stretch and long head emphasis
- **Bench angle too steep or shallow**: 60 degrees is optimal
- **Using too much weight**: Compromises form and ROM
- **Incomplete stretch at bottom**: Missing the key benefit of this variation
- **Shoulders rolling forward**: Maintain retracted scapulae
- **Fast eccentric**: Should control the lowering phase for stretch

### Variations
- **Standard incline curls**: Both arms simultaneously
- **Alternating incline curls**: One arm at a time for focus
- **Offset incline curls**: One arm up while other is down
- **Hammer grip incline curls**: Neutral grip throughout
- **Supinating incline curls**: Start neutral, rotate to supinated at top
- **Bench angles**: 30°, 45°, 60° for different stretch intensities

### Optimal Bench Angle
Setting bench at approximately 60 degrees provides maximal long head stretch. Steeper angles increase stretch but may stress shoulders unnecessarily. Lower than 45 degrees provides minimal additional benefit.

### Long Head Targeting
Because the long head crosses both shoulder and elbow joints, the inclined position places the shoulder in extension (arm behind body). This maximally stretches the long head before contraction begins, leading to superior muscle development.

### Stretch-Mediated Hypertrophy
2024 research shows "stretch-mediated hypertrophy" — training muscles in lengthened positions — produces superior muscle growth. Incline curls maximize this effect by placing biceps in fully stretched position before each contraction.

### Key Benefits
- Maximizes long head development
- Enhances bicep peak
- Improves bicep flexibility
- Reduces ability to cheat (strict form)
- Complements exercises focused on contracted position
- Research-backed for superior hypertrophy

## 19. Seated Calf Raise

### Equipment
- Seated calf raise machine
- Barbell and bench (alternative)
- Smith machine and bench (alternative)

### Primary Muscles
- Soleus (deep calf muscle)

### Secondary Muscles
- Gastrocnemius (minimal due to bent knee position)
- Tibialis posterior
- Forearm flexors (grip)

### Level
Beginner

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Push

### Optimal Rep Range
15-25 reps for hypertrophy (soleus responds to high reps)

### Instructions
1. Adjust seated calf raise machine so knees bend at approximately 90 degrees
2. Position knee pad comfortably just above knees
3. Place balls of feet on platform with toes pointing forward
4. Heels should hang off platform naturally
5. Release safety mechanism and ensure weight rests on knees
6. Lower heels by dorsiflexing ankles to fully stretched position
7. Feel deep stretch in soleus muscle
8. Push up onto tiptoes by plantarflexing ankles
9. Pause at top for 1-2 seconds
10. Squeeze calf muscles maximally at peak contraction
11. Lower back to starting position with control
12. Maintain constant tension throughout set

### Common Mistakes
- **Partial ROM**: Not achieving full stretch at bottom or full contraction at top
- **Bouncing at bottom**: Using momentum instead of muscular contraction
- **Going too fast**: Rushing reps instead of controlled movement
- **Not pausing at top**: Missing peak contraction opportunity
- **Too much weight**: Sacrificing ROM for heavier load
- **Knees sliding forward**: Should maintain 90-degree knee angle

### Variations
- **Standard seated calf raises**: Toes forward (neutral)
- **Toes pointed outward**: Emphasizes medial (inner) calf fibers
- **Toes pointed inward**: Emphasizes lateral (outer) calf fibers
- **Single-leg seated calf raises**: Unilateral work for imbalances
- **Pause reps**: 3-5 second holds at top and/or bottom
- **Barbell seated calf raises**: Using barbell across knees on bench

### Soleus vs. Gastrocnemius
**Seated Calf Raise (Soleus):**
- Knees bent at 90 degrees
- Gastrocnemius in mechanically disadvantaged position
- Soleus does majority of work
- Better for slow-twitch muscle fibers
- Best with high reps (15-25+)

**Standing Calf Raise (Gastrocnemius):**
- Knees straight
- Gastrocnemius in optimal position
- Creates the visible calf "shape"
- Can handle more weight
- Moderate reps (8-15)

### Training Recommendations
Research indicates the soleus comprises primarily slow-twitch muscle fibers. It responds best to:
- Lighter weights
- Higher rep ranges (15-25+)
- Slower tempo with emphasis on stretch and squeeze
- Higher training frequency

## 20. Cable Crossovers

### Equipment
- Dual cable machine with pulleys
- Various handle attachments (D-handles, single grips)

### Primary Muscles
- Pectoralis major (all regions depending on cable height)
- Pectoralis minor

### Secondary Muscles
- Anterior deltoids
- Serratus anterior
- Core stabilizers

### Level
Beginner to Intermediate

### Mechanic
Isolation

### Force
Push (horizontal adduction)

### Optimal Rep Range
10-15 reps for hypertrophy; 12-20 for pump and definition

### Instructions
1. Set cable pulleys at desired height (high, mid, or low)
2. Attach D-handles or single grip handles to each cable
3. Stand in center of cable station, feet staggered for stability
4. Grasp one handle in each hand with palms facing forward
5. Step forward slightly to bring weight off stack
6. Lean torso slightly forward (about 15-20 degrees)
7. Begin with arms extended out to sides, slight elbow bend
8. Bring handles together in wide arc toward center of body
9. Focus on using chest muscles to perform movement
10. Bring handles together in front of body (without touching/banging)
11. Squeeze chest hard at peak contraction for 1-2 seconds
12. Return to starting position slowly, resisting the eccentric
13. Stop when you feel deep stretch on chest (don't go to point of shoulder pain)

### Common Mistakes
- **Touching/banging handles together**: Releases tension at peak contraction
- **Grip too tight**: Over-recruits forearms and biceps
- **Moving too fast**: Rushing instead of controlled movement with constant tension
- **Using shoulders**: Should isolate chest; minimize shoulder involvement
- **Excessive elbow bend**: Turns into pressing movement
- **Shoulder pain**: Going too deep into stretch position

### Variations by Cable Height

**High to Low (Lower Chest Emphasis):**
- Set cables at upper position
- Pull downward and together toward lower abdomen/waist
- Targets lower pec fibers (sternal head)

**Mid-Height (Mid Chest Emphasis):**
- Set cables at chest/shoulder height
- Pull straight forward and together
- Balanced development of entire pectoralis major
- Most common variation

**Low to High (Upper Chest Emphasis):**
- Set cables at lower position
- Pull upward and together toward upper chest/chin
- Targets upper pec fibers (clavicular head)

### Other Variations
- **Single-arm cable crossovers**: Unilateral work for focus and imbalance correction
- **Alternating cable crossovers**: One arm at a time while other stays extended
- **Kneeling cable crossovers**: Removes leg drive for strict chest isolation
- **Decline cable crossovers**: Lying on bench between cables

### Key Advantage: Constant Tension
Unlike dumbbell flyes which lose resistance at certain points due to gravity, cables maintain consistent tension throughout entire ROM. This maximizes time under tension and potentially increases muscle fiber recruitment.

### Technique Focus
- Concentrate on chest muscles, not shoulders or arms
- Control the pace - don't rush
- Emphasize both contraction (bringing handles together) and eccentric (resisting return)
- Maintain slight elbow bend; keep forearms perpendicular to cables
- Don't squeeze handles excessively tight
