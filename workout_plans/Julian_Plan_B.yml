  At the 8 week mark, your muscles will likely need greater stress to continue growing. So we change a few things:

  - We increase the sets per exercise from 3 to 4.
  - We switch to exercises that allow us to scale to heavier weights.
  - We focus on specific muscles within each workout.
  - Since exercise Plan B is more intense, we rest for 4 days between workout day **types**.

  You can do all three workout types on back-to-back days if desired. But you must take 4 days of rest before repeating a day type. For example, you can do Day 1 on Monday, Day 2 on Tuesday, and Day 3 on Wednesday, but you have to wait until Friday to repeat Day 1, Saturday to repeat Day 2, and Sunday to repeat day 3.

  There are no exceptions—even if your muscles “feel fine.” If you wind up overworking your muscles, you can lose an entire workout’s worth of size gains. (You can try proving this to yourself if you’re feeling bold and measure closely.) 

  Here's Plan B. As with Plan A, B exercises are chosen according to the criteria [here](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/workout-plans#exercise-selection) and [here](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/workout-plans#why-missing-exercises).

  The order of exercises and workout days in Plan B is critical. Don't rearrange them or you'll risk not having the strength to complete all your sets.

  The exercises are ordered to allow your muscles adequate recovery time so that exhaustion from one exercise doesn’t make it difficult to perform another that reuses a muscle group. (For example, you use your biceps when performing back exercises. So, avoid doing a back exercise right after a bicep exercise.)

  One of the unique aspects of this program is how Plan B splits some exercises into two sessions per workout. Meaning, 2 sets of one exercise are performed at the beginning of a workout and the remaining 2 sets are performed at the end. (Read more [here](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/workout-plans#rest-times).)

  Notes for exercise Plan B:

  - The exercises in Plan B will require gym equipment, so if you've been working out from home, now’s the time to get into the gym. (Or, buy bigger at-home equipment if you have the room, motivation, and money. Something like [Tonal](http://tonal.com/) might get you partway there if you're short on space.)
  - You no longer have to do grip exercises if you don't want to. Your grip strength should likely remain strong enough since you'll be using it to lift heavy barbells now.
