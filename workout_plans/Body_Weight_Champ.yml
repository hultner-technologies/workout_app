  I created this plan as a body weight only plan to use while traveling to make it possible to workout from hotel rooms with no equipment. Maybe a rubber band for some resistance.

  The goal isn't to create a workout schedule for long term gains but rather as an alternative while you don't have access to a gym. There's no natural weight increase in these exercises, in some you can vary the resistance but it's more about maintenance then building.

  I want to incorporate the following muscles groups.
  Chest, back, bicep, tricep, abs, legs.

  - Chest
    - Pushups
  - Back

    - Superman
    - Alt arm/leg plank
  - Bicep
    - Leg bicep curls
  - Tricep
    - Tricep dips
    - Tricep extensions
  - Abs:
    - Plank
    - Sit ups / Floor crunches
    - Knee to elbow crunches, full abs.
    - Leg raises (lower abs)
  - Legs:
    - name: Bag Squats

    - name: One-legged calf raise
      description: Calf raise on one leg at a time.
