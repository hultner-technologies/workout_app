  If your arms are already as muscular [as these](https://assets.website-files.com/54a5a40be53a05f34703dd18/5793f75a0ad17d3c2b64c172_https-%252F%252Fd2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net%252Fs_47BA25183F58123E5E1B386359348E6870986C628A36A91739F8545AFA7EFAAB_1468603592749_Male%2BPart-way%2BBody%2BTarget.jpg), you can skip exercise Plan A to start with the intermediate Plan B detailed momentarily.

  Otherwise, even if you’ve lifted before, start with exercise Plan A.

  Plan A entails of hitting each muscle group once per workout. It's a starter plan without barbell squats and deadlifts, because these exercises can intimidate beginners from completing workouts. They're also harder to do at home with just dumbbells.

  And the point of this ramp-up period is to get you acclimated to working out with as few excuses as possible. I want you to build the habit of working out — so that it sticks.

  (Barbell squats and deadlifts, however, do become critical in the intermediate plan you quickly transition to.)

  For your first two months of working out, your inexperienced muscles will grow efficiently even with the lesser stimulus of starter Plan A. In other words, Plan A will produce the same results as the more intensive Plan B while requiring less effort and less time. This means you’re more likely to complete this program.

  Eventually Plan A will stop producing size gains for you. When you fail to measure size gains on your arms after a week of working out on Plan A, switch to Plan B. 

  Gains on Plan A should stall around 8 weeks in if you're properly following all the advice in this handbook. If the stall occurs sooner than 6 weeks, and you haven’t worked out extensively in the past year, you may be prematurely plateauing and should refer to the overcoming plateaus section at the bottom of the [cheat sheet](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/workout-plans#workout-plans).
